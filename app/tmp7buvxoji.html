edsl.language_models.exceptions.LanguageModelValueError: No key found for service 'deep_infra'


Exception raised when there's an invalid value in a language model operation.
    
    This exception occurs when:
    - A parameter value is out of its acceptable range
    - A model configuration is invalid or incompatible
    - An operation is attempted with improper settings
    
    To fix this error:
    1. Check parameter values for validity (temperature, max_tokens, etc.)
    2. Ensure model settings are compatible with the chosen provider
    3. Verify that operation parameters are within acceptable ranges
    
    Examples:
        ```python
        # Setting temperature outside valid range
        model = Model("gpt-4", temperature=2.5)  # Raises LanguageModelValueError
        ```

edsl.language_models.exceptions.LanguageModelNoResponseError: Language model did not return a response for question 'dialogue.'


Exception raised when a language model API fails to respond.
    
    This exception occurs when:
    - The language model API cannot be reached (network error)
    - The API request times out
    - The service is unavailable or overloaded
    - Authentication fails (in some cases)
    
    This exception is used in the retry mechanism for handling model API failures,
    particularly during interviews and asynchronous operations.
    
    To fix this error:
    1. Check your internet connection
    2. Verify that the language model service is operational
    3. Increase timeout settings if dealing with complex requests
    4. Check API keys and authentication if applicable
    5. Consider implementing exponential backoff retry logic
    
    Examples:
        ```python
        # API timeout during a model call
        model.generate(prompt="Very complex prompt", timeout=1)  # Raises LanguageModelNoResponseError if timeout is too short
        ```
