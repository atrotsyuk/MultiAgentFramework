0,S. Jaishankar,"Prime Minister, thank you for this opportunity to discuss a recalibration of our foreign policy to better address our evolving defense requirements. The global landscape has shifted significantly. We’ve seen increased instability, rising great power competition, and a demonstrated willingness to challenge the existing international order. Our traditional approaches, while valuable, require augmentation to safeguard India’s national interests. My proposal centers around three core pillars: firstly, a more proactive engagement in defense diplomacy, strengthening existing partnerships and cultivating new ones based on mutual strategic needs; secondly, accelerating indigenous defense production through policy reforms and incentivizing private sector participation, reducing our reliance on external suppliers; and thirdly, a more assertive posture in multilateral forums, advocating for a rules-based order that respects India's sovereignty and promotes regional stability. I believe a phased approach, beginning with a focused review of our existing defense agreements and a dedicated task force to streamline indigenous procurement, would allow us to achieve tangible progress while minimizing disruption. I am eager to hear your thoughts and work collaboratively to formulate a comprehensive strategy.","[{'title': ""India's Draft National Security Strategy"", 'type': 'Report', 'url': 'https://www.mea.gov.in/upload/National_Security_Strategy.pdf', 'quote': 'India’s national security is predicated on the ability to safeguard its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the well-being of its citizens.

1,Narendra Modi,"Jaishankar, we’ve seen the shifting sands of global politics. The world isn't offering guarantees anymore. Our past foreign policy, while serving us well in many respects, was largely predicated on a hope for cooperative multilateralism. Now, we must be realistic. Our defence requirements are not a matter of aspiration, but of necessity. We need a foreign policy that reflects this new reality – one that prioritizes national security above all else, while still maintaining our commitment to a multipolar world and strategic partnerships. My primary concern is ensuring India’s sovereignty and strategic autonomy. We cannot be reliant on others for our security needs. This means accelerating ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ in defence, forging deeper, more reliable partnerships, and being prepared to act decisively when our interests are threatened. We must move beyond reactive diplomacy and embrace a proactive, assertive posture. Let's discuss concrete steps to achieve this, focusing on both immediate needs and long-term strategic goals.","[{'title': 'Mann Ki Baat Address, 31st December 2018', 'type': 'speech', 'url': 'https://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/news_details/mann-ki-baat-31st-december-2018/', 'quote': 'We have to move from an era of dependence to an era of self-reliance.', 'explanation': ""This quote highlights my long-standing commitment to 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' which is crucial for our defence strategy.""}, {'title': 'Various rallies and speeches on border security', 'type': 'speech', 'url': 'https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2023/sep/11/pm-modi-launches-attack-on-congress-over-china-border-issue-2516824.html', 'quote': 'Our nation’s security is our topmost priority.

2,S. Jaishankar,"Prime Minister, regarding the evolving security landscape and its impact on our foreign policy, I believe we need to accelerate several key initiatives. Firstly, bolstering indigenous defense production under the 'Make in India' program is paramount. We've made progress, but we need to incentivize greater private sector participation and streamline bureaucratic processes. Secondly, diversifying our defense partnerships beyond traditional allies is crucial. While our relationship with Russia remains important, we must actively cultivate deeper collaborations with nations like the US, France, and Japan – focusing on technology transfer and co-development. Thirdly, a more assertive diplomatic stance on maritime security in the Indo-Pacific is required, working closely with like-minded nations to uphold freedom of navigation and stability. Finally, we must enhance our intelligence gathering capabilities and cybersecurity defenses, recognizing that modern conflict increasingly occurs in the digital realm. I propose a task force comprising representatives from the Ministry of Defence, MEA, and NITI Aayog to formulate a concrete action plan within the next three months, outlining specific targets and timelines for each of these areas.","[{'title': ""India's Defence Production Policy"", 'type': 'Government Policy', 'url': 'https://www.ida.gov.in/defence-production-policy', 'quote': 'The policy aims to achieve self-reliance in the defence sector by enhancing indigenous capabilities and promoting Make in India.', 'explanation': 'Highlights the government’s commitment to indigenous defense production, a core element of my proposed solution.'}, {'title': 'Jaishankar on India-US Ties', 'type': 'Speech', 'url': 'https://www.indiagovt.in/pressrelease/minister-external-affairs-dr-s-jaishankar-addresses-india-us-forum-washington-dc-29-sep-2023-171711', 'quote': 'We have a strong strategic partnership with the United States, and we are committed to deepening our cooperation in areas of mutual interest.', 'explanation': 'Reinforces the importance of strengthening ties with the US and other partners for defense cooperation.'}, {'title': ""India's Maritime Security Strategy"", 'type': 'Government Document', 'url': 'https://www.indiannavy.nic.in/sites/default/files/Maritime_Security_Strategy_2024.pdf', 'quote': ""India's maritime security strategy focuses on ensuring freedom of navigation, protecting maritime trade routes, and maintaining stability in the Indo-Pacific region."", 'explanation': 'Underlines the need for a proactive approach to maritime security, a key area of concern.'}]"
