0,S. Jaishankar,"President Putin, it's a privilege to be here with you today. India and Russia share a long and deeply valued strategic partnership, built on decades of mutual trust and cooperation. The ongoing situation in Ukraine presents undeniable challenges to the global order, and naturally impacts our bilateral relationship. India has consistently advocated for a peaceful resolution through dialogue and diplomacy, respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations. We acknowledge Russia’s perspective and concerns, and believe a lasting peace requires addressing the underlying security realities. Our immediate priority is to ensure the continued stability of our economic ties, especially concerning energy and defense cooperation, which are vital for India’s developmental needs. We also deeply value the education of Indian students in Russia and the safety of Indian nationals in the region. Looking ahead, we need to proactively shape our partnership to navigate this evolving geopolitical landscape. I propose we establish a joint working group, comprised of senior officials from both our nations, tasked with identifying pragmatic solutions to mitigate the impact of sanctions, diversify trade routes, and explore new avenues for collaboration in areas like digital technology and healthcare. This group should also focus on ensuring continued supply chain resilience, particularly in critical sectors. Ultimately, our shared objective is a stable and multipolar world, and I believe a collaborative approach, grounded in mutual respect and understanding, is the most effective path forward. I am confident that through open and constructive dialogue, we can reaffirm the strength and enduring nature of the India-Russia partnership.","[{'title': ""India's Position on the Ukraine Conflict (MEA)"", 'type': 'speech/article/News', 'url': 'https://www.mea.gov.in/press-releases.htm', 'quote': 'India has been consistently calling for dialogue and diplomacy to resolve the conflict.

1,Vladimir Putin,"Esteemed Mr. Jaishankar, it is a pleasure to continue our dialogue. The current global landscape, as you are well aware, is… complex. The events unfolding in Ukraine, while regrettable, are a direct consequence of decades of Western expansionism and disregard for Russia’s legitimate security concerns. Our priority, as always, is the stability and security of the Russian Federation, and the protection of our people. However, we also recognize the importance of strong, reliable partnerships, and India holds a uniquely valued position in that regard. 

My primary concern, frankly, is the increasingly shrill and, at times, inaccurate portrayal of Russia in Western media and political discourse. This creates unnecessary obstacles to pragmatic cooperation. We must be clear-eyed about the motivations of those seeking to isolate Russia – they are not driven by a genuine concern for international law or human rights, but by a desire to maintain their own dominance. 

Therefore, I propose we focus our discussion on strengthening the existing pillars of our relationship: defense cooperation, energy partnerships, and trade diversification. It is vital that we insulate these areas from the vicissitudes of Western pressure. We have a long history of mutual trust and respect, and it is incumbent upon us to preserve and enhance it, regardless of the temporary disruptions in the global order. Let us discuss concrete steps to achieve this, prioritizing long-term strategic interests over short-term political considerations.","[{'title': ""Putin's Speech at Valdai Discussion Club, 2023"", 'type': 'speech', 'url': 'https://www.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/72073', 'quote': '“The world is changing rapidly.

2,S. Jaishankar,"President Putin, we deeply value the longstanding strategic partnership between India and Russia. However, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine has created a complex and challenging global environment. While we understand Russia’s perspective, India has consistently called for a peaceful resolution through dialogue and diplomacy, adhering to the principles of the UN Charter. We believe a prolonged conflict is detrimental to regional and global stability, and impacts developing nations disproportionately through rising energy and food costs. Moving forward, we need to focus on pragmatic solutions. Specifically, ensuring continued supply of essential goods, including spare parts for our defense equipment, and maintaining open communication channels despite the current geopolitical climate is paramount. We also believe exploring alternative payment mechanisms to facilitate trade, given existing sanctions, is crucial for sustaining our economic cooperation. Finally, we must actively work towards de-escalation and a return to a rules-based international order.","[{'title': ""India's Position on the Ukraine Conflict"", 'type': 'Speech', 'url': 'https://www.mea.gov.in/outreach-posts/india-ukraine-crisis.htm', 'quote': 'India has been consistently calling for dialogue and diplomacy to resolve the conflict.
