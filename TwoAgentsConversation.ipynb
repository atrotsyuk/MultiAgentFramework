This is the second part of module 22 which froze in my PowerPoint. So you just heard the story about the team who found his father in the UK and US became my hero as a early case of DNA re identification.\\n\\n2\\n00:00:21.390 --&gt; 00:00:37.980\\nruss altman: The next thing I want to tell you about, which is worrisome is this idea of identifying individuals for in a mixture. It had been widely assumed that if you have like 1000 people&#x27;s DNA in a mixture and this was somebody studied this because of forensics. Let&#x27;s say you have a\\n\\n3\\n00:00:39.180 --&gt; 00:00:43.140\\nruss altman: Person who&#x27;s not allowed to go to children&#x27;s parks, because they were a sex offender.\\n\\n4\\n00:00:44.490 --&gt; 00:00:56.880\\nruss altman: And you collected DNA at the park. There&#x27;s no way you would be able to figure out if that person was one of the people who had been at that park and left some of their DNA that was an assumption which turned out to be wrong, and in\\n\\n5\\n00:00:58.350 --&gt; 00:01:05.820\\nruss altman: Homer at all published a paper showing that if you have the genome, the genetics of a single individual.\\n\\n6\\n00:01:06.810 --&gt; 00:01:19.320\\nruss altman: And they don&#x27;t even need the whole genome. They just need about a million snips and you can measure a million snips for like 200 bucks 23andMe does a million snips as part of their $99 genetic\\n\\n7\\n00:01:20.430 --&gt; 00:01:36.090\\nruss altman: rundown. So if you can have a million snips for a single individual. And then you have a mixture of 1000 individuals and you want to know is my individual part of that mixture, you can determine that with extremely high confidence.\\n\\n8\\n00:01:37.140 --&gt; 00:01:41.610\\nruss altman: That was a surprise to people. And I just want to give you a sense for how where it comes from.\\n\\n9\\n00:01:44.190 --&gt; 00:01:55.260\\nruss altman: Okay I froze again and that irritates me so I&#x27;m just going to stop the share and restart the share hoping that that solves this problem apologize for this.\\n\\n10\\n00:02:01.260 --&gt; 00:02:03.750\\nruss altman: All right, let&#x27;s see if we can go to the next slide.\\n\\n11\\n00:02:13.050 --&gt; 00:02:18.510\\nruss altman: I do not want to draw that much I mostly want to get in back into my lecture, please.\\n\\n12\\n00:02:23.250 --&gt; 00:02:26.040\\nruss altman: So bush league Ross.\\n\\n13\\n00:02:27.120 --&gt; 00:02:37.830\\nruss altman: How did they do it statistics. So they have a million measurements of the invalid individual, for example, there&#x27;s an A deposition 3432\\n\\n14\\n00:02:39.570 --&gt; 00:02:45.030\\nruss altman: So let&#x27;s assume that 10% of all people in the general population have an A and 90% of a tea.\\n\\n15\\n00:02:45.750 --&gt; 00:03:09.810\\nruss altman: Now you have a million measurements of a mixture of 1000 other people have a mixture of 1000 people from that population. Okay, so let&#x27;s say that in those thousand people. There&#x27;s a 15% rate of a, an attempt at 5% rate of tea at that same position. Now our person had an A at at that position.\\n\\n16\\n00:03:11.250 --&gt; 00:03:14.340\\nruss altman: And you&#x27;re seeing slightly more A&#x27;s.\\n\\n17\\n00:03:15.690 --&gt; 00:03:20.310\\nruss altman: In the mixture than you are in the population at large.\\n\\n18\\n00:03:21.360 --&gt; 00:03:22.320\\nruss altman: Versus 10\\n\\n19\\n00:03:23.370 --&gt; 00:03:34.590\\nruss altman: So this person could have contributed that slight bit of extra a to the mixture does approve anything. Absolutely not.\\n\\n20\\n00:03:34.980 --&gt; 00:03:47.040\\nruss altman: First of all, they could not be in the mixture. Second of all, they could not be contributing to the X ray, but it increases the chance that they were in the mixture a tiny, tiny, tiny bit.\\n\\n21\\n00:03:48.270 --&gt; 00:03:54.870\\nruss altman: Now, so it&#x27;s slightly more probable that that individual is in, then they&#x27;re out\\n\\n22\\n00:03:56.340 --&gt; 00:04:03.600\\nruss altman: Now this is where your intuition loses you though because we have a million such measurements.\\n\\n23\\n00:04:04.020 --&gt; 00:04:15.030\\nruss altman: So every one of these tiny things that&#x27;s either in favor or against the hypothesis that they&#x27;re in the mixture adds up. And it turns out that somewhere around\\n\\n24\\n00:04:15.900 --&gt; 00:04:27.330\\nruss altman: 200 300,000 of these measurements you are positive that that person is either in or out. And then the other 700,000 just serve to increase your certainty.\\n\\n25\\n00:04:28.770 --&gt; 00:04:40.770\\nruss altman: So that&#x27;s a that&#x27;s amazing and true and it showed that people&#x27;s intuitions about went about when DNA is safe in a mixture were wrong.\\n\\n26\\n00:04:41.190 --&gt; 00:04:44.430\\nruss altman: This cause shock waves throughout the National Institutes of Health.\\n\\n27\\n00:04:44.700 --&gt; 00:04:58.080\\nruss altman: Because they had databases, where they said, here is the summary data for 1000 people, they would say 15% 85% t and they thought they were fine. And they didn&#x27;t have to worry about anybody in that study being identified\\n\\n28\\n00:04:58.410 --&gt; 00:05:06.870\\nruss altman: But if you had the genome of one of those 1000 people you could run it through the NIH database. And you could figure out if that person.\\n\\n29\\n00:05:07.230 --&gt; 00:05:09.000\\nruss altman: Participated in a study or not.\\n\\n30\\n00:05:09.390 --&gt; 00:05:21.420\\nruss altman: Why would we care about this. Well, let&#x27;s say the person signed up for a study with a sensitive diagnosis. They were sensitive about the disease that they had, they didn&#x27;t really want the rest of the world to know or their ensures or their employers.\\n\\n31\\n00:05:21.660 --&gt; 00:05:27.930\\nruss altman: And now there&#x27;s a way for somebody to figure out if they&#x27;re part of that mixture and therefore if they might have that disease.\\n\\n32\\n00:05:30.030 --&gt; 00:05:41.940\\nruss altman: This became clear and there was a New York Times article in 2013 where they showed that people could use genetics, plus the state and their age to re identify people\\n\\n33\\n00:05:42.930 --&gt; 00:05:47.700\\nruss altman: And these kinds of articles now are routinely appearing in the New York Times, showing that\\n\\n34\\n00:05:48.180 --&gt; 00:06:10.800\\nruss altman: People&#x27;s assumptions about their privacy with respect to their DNA are in many cases wrong and we really as a society need to discuss what should be the rules. So I just want to leave you with this. I should have mentioned this before I want to tell you about a law. It&#x27;s called the genetic\\n\\n35\\n00:06:13.170 --&gt; 00:06:14.370\\nruss altman: Information\\n\\n36\\n00:06:17.760 --&gt; 00:06:21.780\\nruss altman: Non discrimination act on this.\\n\\n37\\n00:06:23.130 --&gt; 00:06:24.780\\nruss altman: Whoa, let&#x27;s, let&#x27;s, a\\n\\n38\\n00:06:28.170 --&gt; 00:06:31.050\\nruss altman: Non discrimination.\\n\\n39\\n00:06:32.490 --&gt; 00:06:34.320\\nruss altman: Act or Gina\\n\\n40\\n00:06:36.750 --&gt; 00:06:44.250\\nruss altman: Gina was passed to say that you cannot discriminate against people based on their genetic data because the genetic data.\\n\\n41\\n00:06:44.610 --&gt; 00:06:57.240\\nruss altman: Often is manipulating probabilities, but it&#x27;s not giving anything that&#x27;s definite, even if it is definite though it&#x27;s not clear that you should hold it against people in employment or other forms of\\n\\n42\\n00:06:59.190 --&gt; 00:07:07.950\\nruss altman: Of financial transactions Gina is a pretty good act, but it&#x27;s limited because it does not cover disability insurance.\\n\\n43\\n00:07:11.070 --&gt; 00:07:21.750\\nruss altman: And it does not cover life insurance so they can still they being the insurance companies can still discriminate you when they&#x27;re making decisions about life insurance or disability insurance.\\n\\n44\\n00:07:22.110 --&gt; 00:07:26.040\\nruss altman: But they can&#x27;t use it for health insurance. And so that&#x27;s a big one.\\n\\n45\\n00:07:26.730 --&gt; 00:07:32.790\\nruss altman: Because now pre existing genetic information can be used to raise your rates or deny health insurance.\\n\\n46\\n00:07:33.120 --&gt; 00:07:49.980\\nruss altman: So, Gina is imperfect, but it&#x27;s a step in the right direction. Many people think most people believe that we should get rid of these exceptions and maybe we&#x27;ll talk about it in class. Okay, that&#x27;s the end of this second half of module 22\\n\\n&quot;, &#x27;GMT20200420-171758_BioE-131-M.transcript.txt&#x27;: &quot;WEBVTT\\n\\n1\\n00:00:03.179 --&gt; 00:00:08.400\\nruss altman: A bio 131. This is Russ in module 22\\n\\n2\\n00:00:09.719 --&gt; 00:00:22.200\\nruss altman: Now this is not a tech briefing module, but this is Russ, so you&#x27;re not going to get the kind of deep ethical analysis that David usually gives but hopefully we will get you close to ethics.\\n\\n3\\n00:00:22.980 --&gt; 00:00:35.760\\nruss altman: So that we can have a good discussion in class. And so you can think about these things. So this is not being labeled a technical briefing module, but you&#x27;ll see that it has more of the flavor of technical stuff and less of the ethics stuff. So whatever\\n\\n4\\n00:00:36.420 --&gt; 00:00:42.000\\nruss altman: And I hope you&#x27;re all having a good hair day you know hair is becoming an issue for all of us without any haircuts being available and so\\n\\n5\\n00:00:42.900 --&gt; 00:00:56.490\\nruss altman: A re identify ability. This is the idea that people create databases that they think are secure and which cannot have any of the individual participants be re identify\\n\\n6\\n00:00:57.360 --&gt; 00:01:07.080\\nruss altman: And cannot have any of the participants identified, but it&#x27;s false, because bottom line for this module is that\\n\\n7\\n00:01:07.620 --&gt; 00:01:16.530\\nruss altman: Sets of databases can be combined to figure out who is in a database, even if an individual database seems to be secure.\\n\\n8\\n00:01:17.490 --&gt; 00:01:23.790\\nruss altman: So in the technical briefing module. I talked about pharmacogenomics. And this database farm GK be that we&#x27;re building and we got worried\\n\\n9\\n00:01:24.120 --&gt; 00:01:34.230\\nruss altman: Because we were a genetic database. We were supporting research and we had DNA from subjects and we also had phenotype data. Most of the phenotype data was how they responded to drugs.\\n\\n10\\n00:01:35.070 --&gt; 00:01:42.120\\nruss altman: As I said in the last module is about 10 million locations in the genome. And one of the calculations we did and we published this\\n\\n11\\n00:01:42.780 --&gt; 00:01:52.230\\nruss altman: Was that even though there are 10 million locations you only need 60 to 100 of these snips. Remember the snips, the single base pair switches\\n\\n12\\n00:01:52.680 --&gt; 00:02:03.480\\nruss altman: If you tell me 100 positions in your genome and which letter you have that&#x27;s enough typically for you to be unique, other than a\\n\\n13\\n00:02:04.470 --&gt; 00:02:16.380\\nruss altman: Other than a a identical twin. So that was a wake up call for everybody because it was like, wow, you don&#x27;t need a very big piece of DNA to make it like a fingerprint now.\\n\\n14\\n00:02:16.830 --&gt; 00:02:26.520\\nruss altman: The thing is just because you have the DNA and you sequence it and you know those hundred measurements that doesn&#x27;t tell you who the person is unless there&#x27;s another database.\\n\\n15\\n00:02:26.880 --&gt; 00:02:33.630\\nruss altman: That has either the person&#x27;s identification and their DNA. So you could match up the DNA and figure out who the person is\\n\\n16\\n00:02:34.140 --&gt; 00:02:43.860\\nruss altman: Or if it has enough information about that person without giving you their actual name. There&#x27;s enough information for you to figure out their name like\\n\\n17\\n00:02:44.460 --&gt; 00:02:57.630\\nruss altman: All of their geo locations over the last period of time or all of their purchases on Amazon. Again, not as easy as looking up a name. But if you are motivated and if you have a lot of data, you may be able to figure out who they are.\\n\\n18\\n00:02:57.960 --&gt; 00:03:01.890\\nruss altman: And this is what this is about, particularly in the context of genetic data.\\n\\n19\\n00:03:02.700 --&gt; 00:03:13.710\\nruss altman: So as I said, if the genetic data can be associated with the phenotype data, then you might be able to figure out who&#x27;s in a study and I&#x27;ll give you some examples. So we can make it real.\\n\\n20\\n00:03:14.190 --&gt; 00:03:28.620\\nruss altman: In fact, there are examples before DNA was a thing or before it was, you know, measured routinely. There&#x27;s a couple of great cases. My favorite case is the governor of Massachusetts. Well, this was about 20 years ago.\\n\\n21\\n00:03:29.850 --&gt; 00:03:42.480\\nruss altman: He released public health records. And he said, This is great. He said, We&#x27;re going to catalyze research and public health. We&#x27;ve removed all the names and birthdays and addresses.\\n\\n22\\n00:03:43.350 --&gt; 00:03:46.500\\nruss altman: Detailed addresses so you don&#x27;t have to worry about your privacy.\\n\\n23\\n00:03:47.490 --&gt; 00:03:55.680\\nruss altman: And of course, Massachusetts is the home for Harvard Medical School and many other medical schools, and this was going to be a great thing for Massachusetts to have this great data set.\\n\\n24\\n00:03:56.100 --&gt; 00:04:08.820\\nruss altman: Well, three days after governor weld released this data, a researcher at MIT, who was a privacy expert sent governor weld medical records to the Boston Globe.\\n\\n25\\n00:04:09.840 --&gt; 00:04:11.760\\nruss altman: In a beautiful, beautiful moment.\\n\\n26\\n00:04:12.930 --&gt; 00:04:23.940\\nruss altman: And so what did they do well. It was true that the names and addresses had been removed, but they showed that they could use the voter ID roles which are public.\\n\\n27\\n00:04:24.270 --&gt; 00:04:27.090\\nruss altman: And the Department of Motor Vehicle roles which are public.\\n\\n28\\n00:04:27.390 --&gt; 00:04:40.830\\nruss altman: To figure out governor welds age his birthday, where he lives and then the one other thing they had was, they actually the Boston Globe itself had published at peace, saying that the governor had been to the doctor on a certain day\\n\\n29\\n00:04:41.070 --&gt; 00:04:57.450\\nruss altman: And had a clean bill of health. It was like a little public interest piece, but then they knew at least one day when somebody of Governor weld age and in his neighborhood went to a physician that generated a bill and with all of that and the bill was in the public health data.\\n\\n30\\n00:04:58.830 --&gt; 00:05:07.560\\nruss altman: So those data sets, they were able to combine and figure out that that was the governor. Now, could they do this for everybody. Well,\\n\\n31\\n00:05:07.800 --&gt; 00:05:25.980\\nruss altman: Not routinely because we all don&#x27;t have our visits to the doctor put into the Boston Globe, but we all do certain things on Facebook or whatever that might give somebody a clue that would allow them to re identify a data set that otherwise seemed like it might be private and de identified\\n\\n32\\n00:05:27.690 --&gt; 00:05:39.720\\nruss altman: The same researcher went on to show that there&#x27;s a problem in the medical literature with rare diseases. So they, in this case, they went to the New England Journal of Medicine, you know, one of the fanciest medical research journals.\\n\\n33\\n00:05:40.740 --&gt; 00:05:52.320\\nruss altman: And they had like the University of Chicago. I believe had done a study on a rare disease and they had included DNA sequence in in the article.\\n\\n34\\n00:05:53.490 --&gt; 00:06:06.810\\nruss altman: And it was long enough so that it had lots of these snips. Now, my colleague by the way this is Tanya Sweeney, who now. I think I don&#x27;t know where she is now. She had, she had been at MIT. She went to\\n\\n35\\n00:06:08.940 --&gt; 00:06:14.220\\nruss altman: She went to Penn and I think she might be at Harvard. I&#x27;m confused about where she is. But she&#x27;s great.\\n\\n36\\n00:06:15.810 --&gt; 00:06:24.870\\nruss altman: She figured that well let&#x27;s just look at the Chicago area probably people who go to the University of Chicago. Medical Center are in the Chicago area.\\n\\n37\\n00:06:25.080 --&gt; 00:06:33.240\\nruss altman: So, and this is a rare disease. So when she went to the public health records. There was not hundreds and hundreds of people with these diseases, there was like four\\n\\n38\\n00:06:33.630 --&gt; 00:06:45.210\\nruss altman: And then they sit the in the in the New England Journal article the the investigators had also said, oh, and this is a five year old little girl when I, you know, five year old little girl rare diagnosis.\\n\\n39\\n00:06:46.140 --&gt; 00:06:53.430\\nruss altman: Now you know some of that girls little DNA sequence know her DNA was perfectly normal size of the little girl was little.\\n\\n40\\n00:06:54.090 --&gt; 00:07:03.330\\nruss altman: But, you know, now who that patient probably was. Now, of course, my colleague didn&#x27;t do anything nefarious with its information, but she did publish\\n\\n41\\n00:07:03.720 --&gt; 00:07:13.530\\nruss altman: On the fact that there are these risks that people are taking that they might not fully realize when they provide data in such a way that it could be\\n\\n42\\n00:07:14.460 --&gt; 00:07:24.900\\nruss altman: Used to re identify subjects we always ask or we like to think that we always ask patients if we can use their data for research and we&#x27;re very grateful when they consent.\\n\\n43\\n00:07:25.830 --&gt; 00:07:38.940\\nruss altman: But part of that consent is usually a some sort of guarantee that their identity will be kept private and now there&#x27;s a real question about whether you should make a guarantee.\\n\\n44\\n00:07:39.660 --&gt; 00:07:49.920\\nruss altman: Versus just say we&#x27;re going to make best effort to keep your identity private. But these kinds of things can happen. And we would be lying if we said that we can absolutely guaranteed privacy.\\n\\n45\\n00:07:52.170 --&gt; 00:07:56.490\\nruss altman: So we wrote a paper about this, as I said, this is now super old 16 years old.\\n\\n46\\n00:07:58.380 --&gt; 00:08:06.810\\nruss altman: ardo and isn&#x27;t statistics here Jen was a graduate student and we talked about this trade off between genomic research and human subject privacy.\\n\\n47\\n00:08:07.350 --&gt; 00:08:18.960\\nruss altman: So this is the paper where we did the calculation that 60 to 100 snips are basically unique any 60 to 100 snips are basically unique for a person\\n\\n48\\n00:08:19.650 --&gt; 00:08:33.660\\nruss altman: And then we wrote it up as a Policy Forum, because although they liked our scientific finding they thought the more important message might be about what does this mean for a policy about genetic genetic privacy.\\n\\n49\\n00:08:35.190 --&gt; 00:08:47.280\\nruss altman: So here is the EU, I have to delete some of that some of that writing here is the main graph which we came up with it is extremely simple but they liked it.\\n\\n50\\n00:08:48.450 --&gt; 00:08:53.550\\nruss altman: On the x axis. It&#x27;s the number of snips that are measured\\n\\n51\\n00:08:54.960 --&gt; 00:09:02.700\\nruss altman: And on the y axis is a, I would say a qualitative metric of privacy being low, medium, and high\\n\\n52\\n00:09:03.420 --&gt; 00:09:15.150\\nruss altman: Not my most quantitative moment of my career, but what we showed is if you want high privacy. You can only release tiny, tiny amounts of your DNA for any kind of guarantee\\n\\n53\\n00:09:15.600 --&gt; 00:09:21.600\\nruss altman: And as soon as you get up to 100 snips or beyond your privacy is low.\\n\\n54\\n00:09:22.080 --&gt; 00:09:39.030\\nruss altman: But that is precisely where we are going to make discoveries. So we really want to be out here to the far right, which means we have a problem with our guarantees of privacy, which we really should not make and that was the main point of that article.\\n\\n55\\n00:09:43.650 --&gt; 00:09:58.170\\nruss altman: So then comes my one of my favorite stories. I was giving a talk like this, but I didn&#x27;t have a great example of anybody actually using genetic information to re identify and then there was this great story and the, what is that UK\\n\\n56\\n00:09:59.280 --&gt; 00:10:12.180\\nruss altman: That London based, I want to say, The Daily Mail or the or the Guardian one of those had this great story about a teenager in the UK who figured out who his sperm donor father was\\n\\n57\\n00:10:13.080 --&gt; 00:10:29.730\\nruss altman: This team was my hero. So the father donate sperm anonymously 15 years ago he gets some money and they tell him that he will be forever anonymous. The only thing they&#x27;re ever going to give out. And this was their huge mistake was they were going to give out\\n\\n58\\n00:10:31.980 --&gt; 00:10:32.580\\nruss altman: Whoops.\\n\\n59\\n00:10:34.230 --&gt; 00:10:36.150\\nruss altman: The county where he was born.\\n\\n60\\n00:10:37.380 --&gt; 00:10:47.010\\nruss altman: And the year of his birth, and he said, Okay, you know that I come from a very populated County. And there was also many people born that year. Sounds Okay.\\n\\n61\\n00:10:47.520 --&gt; 00:10:57.450\\nruss altman: All right, so a woman gets a sperm donation has a baby baby grows up to be a teenager and is interested in his heritage and also and also smart.\\n\\n62\\n00:11:01.170 --&gt; 00:11:07.650\\nruss altman: There is a company that will use a commercial kid to look at your just your Y chromosome.\\n\\n63\\n00:11:09.150 --&gt; 00:11:19.560\\nruss altman: To tell you which version of the Y chromosome. You have now I will remind you that you get your Y chromosome from your biological father\\n\\n64\\n00:11:20.100 --&gt; 00:11:34.350\\nruss altman: And the kid knew this. So he said, Okay, I&#x27;m gonna find out about my Y chromosome that doesn&#x27;t tell you who your father is you know there&#x27;s 30 or 40 or 50 Y chromosome types, but obviously there&#x27;s a lot of people. However, this website.\\n\\n65\\n00:11:35.520 --&gt; 00:11:47.370\\nruss altman: This company had a website where if you gave up your last name, it would tell you other men who had the same pattern or variation in their Y chromosome. Now, you\\n\\n66\\n00:11:48.600 --&gt; 00:11:57.600\\nruss altman: The other thing you get from your dad in a petrol lineal society is their last name, which is which is what the UK is and was for the most part.\\n\\n67\\n00:11:58.320 --&gt; 00:12:07.170\\nruss altman: So this young man figured out that even if his biological father had not done this Y chromosome analysis.\\n\\n68\\n00:12:07.440 --&gt; 00:12:15.630\\nruss altman: There might be other people from that same family tree with the same Y chromosome, who would share the same last name.\\n\\n69\\n00:12:15.990 --&gt; 00:12:22.980\\nruss altman: So the kid got on the website gave his last name, which was irrelevant. It was whatever his mother&#x27;s or his adoptive father&#x27;s name was\\n\\n70\\n00:12:23.550 --&gt; 00:12:44.880\\nruss altman: But what he found out was all the names associated with that Y chromosome, and he could take the most common one and figure out, ah, this last name that that I&#x27;m seeing most commonly with this Y chromosome is probably my biological father&#x27;s last name. Oh, did we freeze.\\n\\n71\\n00:12:46.800 --&gt; 00:12:53.070\\nruss altman: I think we froze. So I&#x27;m going to stop here and restart because I don&#x27;t want to redo this part of the lecture.\\n\\n72\\n00:12:54.510 --&gt; 00:12:58.380\\nruss altman: But he figured out his last name.\\n\\n73\\n00:12:59.460 --&gt; 00:13:07.680\\nruss altman: Now he knew the county, the year M. The last name. He looked in the phone book he found two people with the same pattern.\\n\\n74\\n00:13:07.980 --&gt; 00:13:16.410\\nruss altman: He called one of them and said, Are you my father. And the guy said, I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about, and hung up, and he called the other one instead. Are you my father, and there was a long pause.\\n\\n75\\n00:13:16.920 --&gt; 00:13:24.510\\nruss altman: Bingo. You found your father, so he can find the he can find the information about age region of birth and year\\n\\n76\\n00:13:25.050 --&gt; 00:13:35.790\\nruss altman: To contact his father, so he really identified this guy who 15 YEARS AGO. GAVE sperm and thought he would never hear about it again, great example. And I&#x27;ll be back with the rest of the module.\\n\\n&quot;, &#x27;GMT20200407-010344_BioE-131-M.transcript.txt&#x27;: &quot;WEBVTT\\n\\n1\\n00:00:02.429 --&gt; 00:00:04.859\\nruss altman: Welcome to Module 11 hello, David.\\n\\n2\\n00:00:05.370 --&gt; 00:00:06.089\\nA Ross.\\n\\n3\\n00:00:07.500 --&gt; 00:00:08.099\\nDavid Magnus: Ready.\\n\\n4\\n00:00:08.610 --&gt; 00:00:13.290\\nDavid Magnus: Away. Today we&#x27;re gonna be talking about the uses of blood spots in research.\\n\\n5\\n00:00:15.120 --&gt; 00:00:27.300\\nDavid Magnus: So California law currently allows a theoretically parents to opt out, but almost none of them know that they can opt out of the uses for research. So in practice they don&#x27;t really have any option.\\n\\n6\\n00:00:28.350 --&gt; 00:00:38.460\\nDavid Magnus: There are people who make a lot of arguments, both in favor and against obtaining consent from people for allowing their uses and research and we&#x27;re going to just summarize some of those arguments.\\n\\n7\\n00:00:40.080 --&gt; 00:00:48.480\\nDavid Magnus: So first of all, there are some regulatory arguments against using a blood spots without consent first\\n\\n8\\n00:00:49.140 --&gt; 00:00:59.130\\nDavid Magnus: How is it even possible to use tissue from somebody without their consent. Well, the law allows the use of of material.\\n\\n9\\n00:00:59.790 --&gt; 00:01:08.580\\nDavid Magnus: As long as it&#x27;s de identified. So as long as the researchers don&#x27;t know who it&#x27;s from. Then under the current regulations that require that we get\\n\\n10\\n00:01:09.300 --&gt; 00:01:21.600\\nDavid Magnus: Informed consent for research, which we talked about earlier in the course, those regulations don&#x27;t apply because unless it&#x27;s identifiable. It doesn&#x27;t count as human subjects research.\\n\\n11\\n00:01:22.920 --&gt; 00:01:28.770\\nDavid Magnus: However, for this and this has really been the basis of why a lot of this blood spot. Research has taken place.\\n\\n12\\n00:01:29.010 --&gt; 00:01:37.890\\nDavid Magnus: However, and we&#x27;re going to be talking about this issue of re identification in much more detail in a future class, but the idea that you could have data.\\n\\n13\\n00:01:38.220 --&gt; 00:01:53.130\\nDavid Magnus: And especially genomic data and claim that it&#x27;s the identified has become increasingly problematic. And what that means is that the loophole in a way that people have been using to justify research without consent.\\n\\n14\\n00:01:54.630 --&gt; 00:01:56.730\\nDavid Magnus: Is getting harder and harder to maintain\\n\\n15\\n00:01:57.810 --&gt; 00:01:59.970\\nDavid Magnus: And some of the new regulations governing\\n\\n16\\n00:02:01.080 --&gt; 00:02:09.720\\nDavid Magnus: Research with blood spots explicitly says we should think of these things as identifiable therefore that loophole goes away.\\n\\n17\\n00:02:10.620 --&gt; 00:02:19.140\\nDavid Magnus: In addition to this regulatory argument. There&#x27;s also an ethical argument against using samples for research without consent.\\n\\n18\\n00:02:20.130 --&gt; 00:02:34.650\\nDavid Magnus: A lot of bioethicists have have done studies and surveys and they show that most of the public wants to be asked for permission before their samples are used. In fact, the people behind the campaigns in Minnesota.\\n\\n19\\n00:02:34.980 --&gt; 00:02:40.890\\nDavid Magnus: And in Texas that led to the destruction of their blood spots what the leaders all said was\\n\\n20\\n00:02:41.160 --&gt; 00:02:53.520\\nDavid Magnus: I would have consented, and let you use my blood spots, but doing it without buying permission is just wrong, and therefore I we bought these blood spot should be thrown out and you shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to do this unless you ask for permission first.\\n\\n21\\n00:02:55.860 --&gt; 00:02:58.650\\nDavid Magnus: privacy rights regarding control of this information.\\n\\n22\\n00:02:59.670 --&gt; 00:03:05.220\\nDavid Magnus: suggests a violation. So that&#x27;s the ontological concern that this is a violation of them as individuals.\\n\\n23\\n00:03:05.610 --&gt; 00:03:20.730\\nDavid Magnus: Moreover, it&#x27;s really important that the public have trust in the research community and we know that consent can play an important role in that process, a group of researchers led by Jeff Bob can have done a study of\\n\\n24\\n00:03:22.080 --&gt; 00:03:30.270\\nDavid Magnus: Of thinking about how what the best approach to this is when they looked at all the empirical studies of public attitudes parental attitudes.\\n\\n25\\n00:03:30.510 --&gt; 00:03:36.720\\nDavid Magnus: When they look at all the guideline statements from professional bodies as well as actual state policies.\\n\\n26\\n00:03:37.320 --&gt; 00:03:48.810\\nDavid Magnus: They use that as a basis for an expert working group and the result was that they made some recommendations, though most people when you ask them prefer opt in consent, where you actually say Can I have permission.\\n\\n27\\n00:03:49.590 --&gt; 00:03:57.030\\nDavid Magnus: The group concluded that opt out consent was justifiable, that is, you would still ask for permission but the default\\n\\n28\\n00:03:57.930 --&gt; 00:04:09.000\\nDavid Magnus: Would be that they would that they were presumed to be in the research, unless they explicitly said, I don&#x27;t want to be a part of it. And this creates a little bit of a nudge using trace art, architecture in favor of it.\\n\\n29\\n00:04:09.540 --&gt; 00:04:15.060\\nruss altman: Just compose there. I believe there&#x27;s a ton of data that you get very different\\n\\n30\\n00:04:15.750 --&gt; 00:04:26.940\\nruss altman: numbers of people signing up in opt in versus opt out. So even though, in theory, saying opt in or opt out should lead to the same number, depending if you&#x27;re making your decisions solely on your preferences.\\n\\n31\\n00:04:27.480 --&gt; 00:04:36.360\\nruss altman: There&#x27;s a literature that shows that when you opt in, you get if it&#x27;s automatic opt in, you get way less people than if you automatically opt them out.\\n\\n32\\n00:04:36.870 --&gt; 00:04:46.980\\nDavid Magnus: That&#x27;s correct. That&#x27;s really why choice architecture and and preset preferences really work to have a different have an impact on on on people&#x27;s behavior.\\n\\n33\\n00:04:48.120 --&gt; 00:04:55.350\\nDavid Magnus: But, of course, the more robust that the opt out consent is, the more it gets like opt in.\\n\\n34\\n00:04:55.620 --&gt; 00:04:57.360\\nDavid Magnus: Then the less that impact has\\n\\n35\\n00:04:58.860 --&gt; 00:05:02.760\\nDavid Magnus: So, and, and one of the things that some of the researchers found is\\n\\n36\\n00:05:03.000 --&gt; 00:05:10.170\\nDavid Magnus: People who said, I think I should opt in. When explained why they didn&#x27;t think that was a good idea because you wouldn&#x27;t have robust enough numbers.\\n\\n37\\n00:05:10.380 --&gt; 00:05:23.340\\nDavid Magnus: The data wouldn&#x27;t be as useful. And what if we did a really robust opt out. Most people come around to saying opt out would be okay. And so that&#x27;s more or less the majority view in the bioethics community.\\n\\n38\\n00:05:23.820 --&gt; 00:05:30.060\\nDavid Magnus: But there are some important arguments in favor of using even unscented blood spots and maybe not requiring consent.\\n\\n39\\n00:05:31.410 --&gt; 00:05:39.240\\nDavid Magnus: Obviously, currently, it doesn&#x27;t count as human subjects under the regulations. If it&#x27;s the identified, but we&#x27;ve already seen that that may be problematic.\\n\\n40\\n00:05:40.380 --&gt; 00:05:49.830\\nDavid Magnus: But what some other arguments in favor include the fact that to some extent there, whether you consent or not. There has to be some research like activities.\\n\\n41\\n00:05:50.160 --&gt; 00:05:57.540\\nDavid Magnus: With blood spots, whether there&#x27;s consent or not. And that&#x27;s because even be to be able to order to use them for clinical purposes.\\n\\n42\\n00:05:57.810 --&gt; 00:06:06.570\\nDavid Magnus: You have to have quality assurance and quality improvement activities that take place on a regular basis to make sure that the test really work the way you think they do.\\n\\n43\\n00:06:06.870 --&gt; 00:06:17.820\\nDavid Magnus: And you, there is no way of opting out of that. So a very research like activity has to take place anyway, even without research and that QA QA work is\\n\\n44\\n00:06:18.510 --&gt; 00:06:28.110\\nDavid Magnus: Is outside of the regulatory system and so is allowed to be done. Moreover, the one of the worries that a lot of people have about creating even an opt out.\\n\\n45\\n00:06:28.830 --&gt; 00:06:41.760\\nDavid Magnus: consent process is that you will have less people in the databases and that that will lead to both less data less robust data and, especially, there&#x27;s a concern that that data may become\\n\\n46\\n00:06:42.180 --&gt; 00:06:53.610\\nDavid Magnus: wider and more educated and more middle class, middle class to athletes, because in general when you require consent even opt out consent, you wind up getting\\n\\n47\\n00:06:54.060 --&gt; 00:07:05.340\\nDavid Magnus: More people who are white signing up for research and you end up having less ethnic and racial minorities in groups that are underrepresented in research traditionally be included.\\n\\n48\\n00:07:06.630 --&gt; 00:07:08.700\\nDavid Magnus: Our colleague Carlos Bustamante\\n\\n49\\n00:07:09.780 --&gt; 00:07:11.130\\nDavid Magnus: This was must have been about\\n\\n50\\n00:07:12.210 --&gt; 00:07:21.780\\nDavid Magnus: Something like around eight or 10 years ago looked at genome wide association studies and at that time they were almost all done on people of European descent.\\n\\n51\\n00:07:22.110 --&gt; 00:07:28.020\\nDavid Magnus: A few years later, it got a little bit better in the US, but it was still about 96% or 94%\\n\\n52\\n00:07:28.890 --&gt; 00:07:37.230\\nDavid Magnus: From people of European descent in the research in the US and up until I would say, up until now there&#x27;s efforts to try to improve that with things like the\\n\\n53\\n00:07:37.530 --&gt; 00:07:53.940\\nDavid Magnus: All of us research program, but the truth is that most research repositories remain mostly middle class educated white people, which we know already know a lot about. And when you increase the consent requirements you make the the data more biased.\\n\\n54\\n00:07:54.330 --&gt; 00:08:00.480\\nruss altman: And saying if those underrepresented groups don&#x27;t trust the Healthcare Research Establishment\\n\\n55\\n00:08:01.620 --&gt; 00:08:06.090\\nruss altman: Is it really the right thing to do, to say, well, we&#x27;re going to take that choice away from you.\\n\\n56\\n00:08:06.390 --&gt; 00:08:10.500\\nDavid Magnus: So that&#x27;s a really great question. And that really relates to the question of really\\n\\n57\\n00:08:11.100 --&gt; 00:08:16.920\\nDavid Magnus: What establishes trust. And so the people who want to defend the unconsidered blood spots.\\n\\n58\\n00:08:17.220 --&gt; 00:08:26.460\\nDavid Magnus: Are skeptical that informed consent forms and a few lines and informed consent form that people barely read and sign or refuse to sign\\n\\n59\\n00:08:26.760 --&gt; 00:08:36.720\\nDavid Magnus: Really is a very powerful way of demonstrating respect for the research participants and that will we need to do is keep these people included in the research.\\n\\n60\\n00:08:36.960 --&gt; 00:08:50.160\\nDavid Magnus: Because unconsidered blood spots are the most diverse databases that we have for lunch genomic point of view, but to actually find other more meaningful ways of demonstrating respect for those populations.\\n\\n61\\n00:08:50.790 --&gt; 00:09:00.990\\nDavid Magnus: Rather than relying on a few lot you know a few maybe even just a few paragraphs of an informed consent form that&#x27;s probably not understand unless they&#x27;re their lawyers.\\n\\n62\\n00:09:01.920 --&gt; 00:09:08.970\\nDavid Magnus: There&#x27;s no evidence that anybody has ever been harmed. As a result of a stored sample for decades. So the risk is low.\\n\\n63\\n00:09:09.420 --&gt; 00:09:15.870\\nDavid Magnus: And another thing that&#x27;s really important is that there&#x27;s evidence that people do value the research.\\n\\n64\\n00:09:16.380 --&gt; 00:09:22.020\\nDavid Magnus: That&#x27;s being done. So on the one hand, we want to respect the fact that people are saying, I want to give consent.\\n\\n65\\n00:09:22.350 --&gt; 00:09:30.000\\nDavid Magnus: But people are also saying when you give those people surveys. I want there to be a robust database of research and for this research to take place.\\n\\n66\\n00:09:30.240 --&gt; 00:09:38.820\\nDavid Magnus: The same surveys show that very clearly and what&#x27;s happened is that the bioethics community has basically said we&#x27;re going to give priority to one preference over another.\\n\\n67\\n00:09:39.120 --&gt; 00:09:46.860\\nDavid Magnus: But people don&#x27;t really ask that question, so they don&#x27;t ask the people like well you want the research to take place and you also want to give consent.\\n\\n68\\n00:09:47.070 --&gt; 00:09:53.490\\nDavid Magnus: But those two things may be incompatible, to some extent, and if they don&#x27;t fit together. Which do you think is more important.\\n\\n69\\n00:09:53.760 --&gt; 00:10:01.620\\nDavid Magnus: That turns out to be very hard to study, it&#x27;s not been studied very much but we&#x27;ve gotten some surprising answers when we&#x27;ve tried to explore some of those issues.\\n\\n70\\n00:10:01.860 --&gt; 00:10:12.510\\nDavid Magnus: In a study that we did, we found that 70% of people said they&#x27;d be willing to forgo consent or or lower the consent requirements in order for research to be possible.\\n\\n71\\n00:10:12.780 --&gt; 00:10:17.790\\nruss altman: Let me just say that my pen just ran out of ink. So we&#x27;re on our own from here on out. But keep going.\\n\\n72\\n00:10:18.060 --&gt; 00:10:33.720\\nDavid Magnus: Okay, so I&#x27;ll just say that one of the other challenges is when you ask people for consent. If it&#x27;s very specific consent about each particular research project that really becomes impossible and would make the research databases useless.\\n\\n73\\n00:10:34.740 --&gt; 00:10:35.670\\nDavid Magnus: There you go. Got it back.\\n\\n74\\n00:10:36.390 --&gt; 00:10:38.220\\nruss altman: I unplugged it and plugged it back in.\\n\\n75\\n00:10:38.520 --&gt; 00:10:49.740\\nDavid Magnus: Okay, there we go. So, so, so, so, so specific consent really would make the research unusable because you couldn&#x27;t ask. Go, go back to\\n\\n76\\n00:10:50.040 --&gt; 00:10:56.550\\nDavid Magnus: The database. Go back to, to all the blood spots and try and track everybody down for every time a researcher wanted to use this\\n\\n77\\n00:10:56.790 --&gt; 00:11:05.400\\nDavid Magnus: Which would mean that if you were going to have consent at all. It would have to be a very broad consent, which, again, if you&#x27;re thinking about this as a way of demonstrating respect telling them.\\n\\n78\\n00:11:05.760 --&gt; 00:11:13.350\\nDavid Magnus: We&#x27;re going to do use your blood spots for research. We don&#x27;t know exactly what&#x27;s going to be done with them, they&#x27;ll be some kind of genomic or genetic analysis done\\n\\n79\\n00:11:13.620 --&gt; 00:11:21.360\\nDavid Magnus: We can&#x27;t really predict what it&#x27;s going to be, it doesn&#x27;t really tell you very much. If you have broad consent and and yet.\\n\\n80\\n00:11:22.560 --&gt; 00:11:32.880\\nDavid Magnus: If you don&#x27;t, if you try to, as I said, have specific consent for every research project, then it would actually make the research absolutely impossible to take place.\\n\\n81\\n00:11:33.810 --&gt; 00:11:40.050\\nDavid Magnus: So cheer, there&#x27;s a trade off. People want to give consent. They want the research to take place and they want to reap its benefits.\\n\\n82\\n00:11:40.830 --&gt; 00:11:48.450\\nDavid Magnus: So studying this issue is really something that we need to do more of to see what people think of, but we also need to be\\n\\n83\\n00:11:49.080 --&gt; 00:11:57.990\\nDavid Magnus: Aware of what our options are for trying to have data that&#x27;s truly diverse and useful for researchers\\n\\n84\\n00:11:58.560 --&gt; 00:12:04.770\\nDavid Magnus: While also being respectful to participants. There&#x27;s one last wrinkle. I just want to mention, and that is\\n\\n85\\n00:12:05.550 --&gt; 00:12:17.400\\nDavid Magnus: So far we&#x27;ve been talking about this in the US context, but at least some other countries, and there&#x27;s always the potential in this country as well that there could be negative associations with some of this. So for example, in China.\\n\\n86\\n00:12:17.910 --&gt; 00:12:26.610\\nDavid Magnus: Police collected biometric information and samples of 19 million people who were being a press who are Muslims\\n\\n87\\n00:12:27.570 --&gt; 00:12:30.480\\nDavid Magnus: And using some of these technologies to try and figure out\\n\\n88\\n00:12:31.170 --&gt; 00:12:38.670\\nDavid Magnus: Who, who, people were from their DNA and to try and figure out facial patterns that they would expect to see what people would look like from their DNA.\\n\\n89\\n00:12:38.940 --&gt; 00:12:53.250\\nDavid Magnus: So they could identify them from seeing them in crowds and things like that. So there&#x27;s definitely the potential that this technology could be abused by the state or by other commercial entities and so we need to be aware of the fact that that that\\n\\n90\\n00:12:54.300 --&gt; 00:13:12.630\\nDavid Magnus: Doing this in a respectful manner requires that the uses of it be protected and some of the mechanisms for doing that include things like having really important and good governance and oversight of this research so that these kinds of uses. Don&#x27;t take place.\\n\\n91\\n00:13:14.100 --&gt; 00:13:15.000\\nDavid Magnus: And that&#x27;s it.\\n\\n92\\n00:13:15.870 --&gt; 00:13:23.160\\nruss altman: That was it. Thank you very much, the issues related to using blood spots for research. Sorry about the little pen.\\n\\n93\\n00:13:24.300 --&gt; 00:13:29.010\\nruss altman: Issue, but we will stop the share and we will stop the meeting. Thanks.\\n\\n&quot;}\n",

This is the second part of module 22 which froze in my PowerPoint. So you just heard the story about the team who found his father in the UK and US became my hero as a early case of DNA re identification.\\n\\n2\\n00:00:21.390 --&gt; 00:00:37.980\\nruss altman: The next thing I want to tell you about, which is worrisome is this idea of identifying individuals for in a mixture. It had been widely assumed that if you have like 1000 people&#x27;s DNA in a mixture and this was somebody studied this because of forensics. Let&#x27;s say you have a\\n\\n3\\n00:00:39.180 --&gt; 00:00:43.140\\nruss altman: Person who&#x27;s not allowed to go to children&#x27;s parks, because they were a sex offender.\\n\\n4\\n00:00:44.490 --&gt; 00:00:56.880\\nruss altman: And you collected DNA at the park. There&#x27;s no way you would be able to figure out if that person was one of the people who had been at that park and left some of their DNA that was an assumption which turned out to be wrong, and in\\n\\n5\\n00:00:58.350 --&gt; 00:01:05.820\\nruss altman: Homer at all published a paper showing that if you have the genome, the genetics of a single individual.\\n\\n6\\n00:01:06.810 --&gt; 00:01:19.320\\nruss altman: And they don&#x27;t even need the whole genome. They just need about a million snips and you can measure a million snips for like 200 bucks 23andMe does a million snips as part of their $99 genetic\\n\\n7\\n00:01:20.430 --&gt; 00:01:36.090\\nruss altman: rundown. So if you can have a million snips for a single individual. And then you have a mixture of 1000 individuals and you want to know is my individual part of that mixture, you can determine that with extremely high confidence.\\n\\n8\\n00:01:37.140 --&gt; 00:01:41.610\\nruss altman: That was a surprise to people. And I just want to give you a sense for how where it comes from.\\n\\n9\\n00:01:44.190 --&gt; 00:01:55.260\\nruss altman: Okay I froze again and that irritates me so I&#x27;m just going to stop the share and restart the share hoping that that solves this problem apologize for this.\\n\\n10\\n00:02:01.260 --&gt; 00:02:03.750\\nruss altman: All right, let&#x27;s see if we can go to the next slide.\\n\\n11\\n00:02:13.050 --&gt; 00:02:18.510\\nruss altman: I do not want to draw that much I mostly want to get in back into my lecture, please.\\n\\n12\\n00:02:23.250 --&gt; 00:02:26.040\\nruss altman: So bush league Ross.\\n\\n13\\n00:02:27.120 --&gt; 00:02:37.830\\nruss altman: How did they do it statistics. So they have a million measurements of the invalid individual, for example, there&#x27;s an A deposition 3432\\n\\n14\\n00:02:39.570 --&gt; 00:02:45.030\\nruss altman: So let&#x27;s assume that 10% of all people in the general population have an A and 90% of a tea.\\n\\n15\\n00:02:45.750 --&gt; 00:03:09.810\\nruss altman: Now you have a million measurements of a mixture of 1000 other people have a mixture of 1000 people from that population. Okay, so let&#x27;s say that in those thousand people. There&#x27;s a 15% rate of a, an attempt at 5% rate of tea at that same position. Now our person had an A at at that position.\\n\\n16\\n00:03:11.250 --&gt; 00:03:14.340\\nruss altman: And you&#x27;re seeing slightly more A&#x27;s.\\n\\n17\\n00:03:15.690 --&gt; 00:03:20.310\\nruss altman: In the mixture than you are in the population at large.\\n\\n18\\n00:03:21.360 --&gt; 00:03:22.320\\nruss altman: Versus 10\\n\\n19\\n00:03:23.370 --&gt; 00:03:34.590\\nruss altman: So this person could have contributed that slight bit of extra a to the mixture does approve anything. Absolutely not.\\n\\n20\\n00:03:34.980 --&gt; 00:03:47.040\\nruss altman: First of all, they could not be in the mixture. Second of all, they could not be contributing to the X ray, but it increases the chance that they were in the mixture a tiny, tiny, tiny bit.\\n\\n21\\n00:03:48.270 --&gt; 00:03:54.870\\nruss altman: Now, so it&#x27;s slightly more probable that that individual is in, then they&#x27;re out\\n\\n22\\n00:03:56.340 --&gt; 00:04:03.600\\nruss altman: Now this is where your intuition loses you though because we have a million such measurements.\\n\\n23\\n00:04:04.020 --&gt; 00:04:15.030\\nruss altman: So every one of these tiny things that&#x27;s either in favor or against the hypothesis that they&#x27;re in the mixture adds up. And it turns out that somewhere around\\n\\n24\\n00:04:15.900 --&gt; 00:04:27.330\\nruss altman: 200 300,000 of these measurements you are positive that that person is either in or out. And then the other 700,000 just serve to increase your certainty.\\n\\n25\\n00:04:28.770 --&gt; 00:04:40.770\\nruss altman: So that&#x27;s a that&#x27;s amazing and true and it showed that people&#x27;s intuitions about went about when DNA is safe in a mixture were wrong.\\n\\n26\\n00:04:41.190 --&gt; 00:04:44.430\\nruss altman: This cause shock waves throughout the National Institutes of Health.\\n\\n27\\n00:04:44.700 --&gt; 00:04:58.080\\nruss altman: Because they had databases, where they said, here is the summary data for 1000 people, they would say 15% 85% t and they thought they were fine. And they didn&#x27;t have to worry about anybody in that study being identified\\n\\n28\\n00:04:58.410 --&gt; 00:05:06.870\\nruss altman: But if you had the genome of one of those 1000 people you could run it through the NIH database. And you could figure out if that person.\\n\\n29\\n00:05:07.230 --&gt; 00:05:09.000\\nruss altman: Participated in a study or not.\\n\\n30\\n00:05:09.390 --&gt; 00:05:21.420\\nruss altman: Why would we care about this. Well, let&#x27;s say the person signed up for a study with a sensitive diagnosis. They were sensitive about the disease that they had, they didn&#x27;t really want the rest of the world to know or their ensures or their employers.\\n\\n31\\n00:05:21.660 --&gt; 00:05:27.930\\nruss altman: And now there&#x27;s a way for somebody to figure out if they&#x27;re part of that mixture and therefore if they might have that disease.\\n\\n32\\n00:05:30.030 --&gt; 00:05:41.940\\nruss altman: This became clear and there was a New York Times article in 2013 where they showed that people could use genetics, plus the state and their age to re identify people\\n\\n33\\n00:05:42.930 --&gt; 00:05:47.700\\nruss altman: And these kinds of articles now are routinely appearing in the New York Times, showing that\\n\\n34\\n00:05:48.180 --&gt; 00:06:10.800\\nruss altman: People&#x27;s assumptions about their privacy with respect to their DNA are in many cases wrong and we really as a society need to discuss what should be the rules. So I just want to leave you with this. I should have mentioned this before I want to tell you about a law. It&#x27;s called the genetic\\n\\n35\\n00:06:13.170 --&gt; 00:06:14.370\\nruss altman: Information\\n\\n36\\n00:06:17.760 --&gt; 00:06:21.780\\nruss altman: Non discrimination act on this.\\n\\n37\\n00:06:23.130 --&gt; 00:06:24.780\\nruss altman: Whoa, let&#x27;s, let&#x27;s, a\\n\\n38\\n00:06:28.170 --&gt; 00:06:31.050\\nruss altman: Non discrimination.\\n\\n39\\n00:06:32.490 --&gt; 00:06:34.320\\nruss altman: Act or Gina\\n\\n40\\n00:06:36.750 --&gt; 00:06:44.250\\nruss altman: Gina was passed to say that you cannot discriminate against people based on their genetic data because the genetic data.\\n\\n41\\n00:06:44.610 --&gt; 00:06:57.240\\nruss altman: Often is manipulating probabilities, but it&#x27;s not giving anything that&#x27;s definite, even if it is definite though it&#x27;s not clear that you should hold it against people in employment or other forms of\\n\\n42\\n00:06:59.190 --&gt; 00:07:07.950\\nruss altman: Of financial transactions Gina is a pretty good act, but it&#x27;s limited because it does not cover disability insurance.\\n\\n43\\n00:07:11.070 --&gt; 00:07:21.750\\nruss altman: And it does not cover life insurance so they can still they being the insurance companies can still discriminate you when they&#x27;re making decisions about life insurance or disability insurance.\\n\\n44\\n00:07:22.110 --&gt; 00:07:26.040\\nruss altman: But they can&#x27;t use it for health insurance. And so that&#x27;s a big one.\\n\\n45\\n00:07:26.730 --&gt; 00:07:32.790\\nruss altman: Because now pre existing genetic information can be used to raise your rates or deny health insurance.\\n\\n46\\n00:07:33.120 --&gt; 00:07:49.980\\nruss altman: So, Gina is imperfect, but it&#x27;s a step in the right direction. Many people think most people believe that we should get rid of these exceptions and maybe we&#x27;ll talk about it in class. Okay, that&#x27;s the end of this second half of module 22\\n\\n&quot;, &#x27;GMT20200420-171758_BioE-131-M.transcript.txt&#x27;: &quot;WEBVTT\\n\\n1\\n00:00:03.179 --&gt; 00:00:08.400\\nruss altman: A bio 131. This is Russ in module 22\\n\\n2\\n00:00:09.719 --&gt; 00:00:22.200\\nruss altman: Now this is not a tech briefing module, but this is Russ, so you&#x27;re not going to get the kind of deep ethical analysis that David usually gives but hopefully we will get you close to ethics.\\n\\n3\\n00:00:22.980 --&gt; 00:00:35.760\\nruss altman: So that we can have a good discussion in class. And so you can think about these things. So this is not being labeled a technical briefing module, but you&#x27;ll see that it has more of the flavor of technical stuff and less of the ethics stuff. So whatever\\n\\n4\\n00:00:36.420 --&gt; 00:00:42.000\\nruss altman: And I hope you&#x27;re all having a good hair day you know hair is becoming an issue for all of us without any haircuts being available and so\\n\\n5\\n00:00:42.900 --&gt; 00:00:56.490\\nruss altman: A re identify ability. This is the idea that people create databases that they think are secure and which cannot have any of the individual participants be re identify\\n\\n6\\n00:00:57.360 --&gt; 00:01:07.080\\nruss altman: And cannot have any of the participants identified, but it&#x27;s false, because bottom line for this module is that\\n\\n7\\n00:01:07.620 --&gt; 00:01:16.530\\nruss altman: Sets of databases can be combined to figure out who is in a database, even if an individual database seems to be secure.\\n\\n8\\n00:01:17.490 --&gt; 00:01:23.790\\nruss altman: So in the technical briefing module. I talked about pharmacogenomics. And this database farm GK be that we&#x27;re building and we got worried\\n\\n9\\n00:01:24.120 --&gt; 00:01:34.230\\nruss altman: Because we were a genetic database. We were supporting research and we had DNA from subjects and we also had phenotype data. Most of the phenotype data was how they responded to drugs.\\n\\n10\\n00:01:35.070 --&gt; 00:01:42.120\\nruss altman: As I said in the last module is about 10 million locations in the genome. And one of the calculations we did and we published this\\n\\n11\\n00:01:42.780 --&gt; 00:01:52.230\\nruss altman: Was that even though there are 10 million locations you only need 60 to 100 of these snips. Remember the snips, the single base pair switches\\n\\n12\\n00:01:52.680 --&gt; 00:02:03.480\\nruss altman: If you tell me 100 positions in your genome and which letter you have that&#x27;s enough typically for you to be unique, other than a\\n\\n13\\n00:02:04.470 --&gt; 00:02:16.380\\nruss altman: Other than a a identical twin. So that was a wake up call for everybody because it was like, wow, you don&#x27;t need a very big piece of DNA to make it like a fingerprint now.\\n\\n14\\n00:02:16.830 --&gt; 00:02:26.520\\nruss altman: The thing is just because you have the DNA and you sequence it and you know those hundred measurements that doesn&#x27;t tell you who the person is unless there&#x27;s another database.\\n\\n15\\n00:02:26.880 --&gt; 00:02:33.630\\nruss altman: That has either the person&#x27;s identification and their DNA. So you could match up the DNA and figure out who the person is\\n\\n16\\n00:02:34.140 --&gt; 00:02:43.860\\nruss altman: Or if it has enough information about that person without giving you their actual name. There&#x27;s enough information for you to figure out their name like\\n\\n17\\n00:02:44.460 --&gt; 00:02:57.630\\nruss altman: All of their geo locations over the last period of time or all of their purchases on Amazon. Again, not as easy as looking up a name. But if you are motivated and if you have a lot of data, you may be able to figure out who they are.\\n\\n18\\n00:02:57.960 --&gt; 00:03:01.890\\nruss altman: And this is what this is about, particularly in the context of genetic data.\\n\\n19\\n00:03:02.700 --&gt; 00:03:13.710\\nruss altman: So as I said, if the genetic data can be associated with the phenotype data, then you might be able to figure out who&#x27;s in a study and I&#x27;ll give you some examples. So we can make it real.\\n\\n20\\n00:03:14.190 --&gt; 00:03:28.620\\nruss altman: In fact, there are examples before DNA was a thing or before it was, you know, measured routinely. There&#x27;s a couple of great cases. My favorite case is the governor of Massachusetts. Well, this was about 20 years ago.\\n\\n21\\n00:03:29.850 --&gt; 00:03:42.480\\nruss altman: He released public health records. And he said, This is great. He said, We&#x27;re going to catalyze research and public health. We&#x27;ve removed all the names and birthdays and addresses.\\n\\n22\\n00:03:43.350 --&gt; 00:03:46.500\\nruss altman: Detailed addresses so you don&#x27;t have to worry about your privacy.\\n\\n23\\n00:03:47.490 --&gt; 00:03:55.680\\nruss altman: And of course, Massachusetts is the home for Harvard Medical School and many other medical schools, and this was going to be a great thing for Massachusetts to have this great data set.\\n\\n24\\n00:03:56.100 --&gt; 00:04:08.820\\nruss altman: Well, three days after governor weld released this data, a researcher at MIT, who was a privacy expert sent governor weld medical records to the Boston Globe.\\n\\n25\\n00:04:09.840 --&gt; 00:04:11.760\\nruss altman: In a beautiful, beautiful moment.\\n\\n26\\n00:04:12.930 --&gt; 00:04:23.940\\nruss altman: And so what did they do well. It was true that the names and addresses had been removed, but they showed that they could use the voter ID roles which are public.\\n\\n27\\n00:04:24.270 --&gt; 00:04:27.090\\nruss altman: And the Department of Motor Vehicle roles which are public.\\n\\n28\\n00:04:27.390 --&gt; 00:04:40.830\\nruss altman: To figure out governor welds age his birthday, where he lives and then the one other thing they had was, they actually the Boston Globe itself had published at peace, saying that the governor had been to the doctor on a certain day\\n\\n29\\n00:04:41.070 --&gt; 00:04:57.450\\nruss altman: And had a clean bill of health. It was like a little public interest piece, but then they knew at least one day when somebody of Governor weld age and in his neighborhood went to a physician that generated a bill and with all of that and the bill was in the public health data.\\n\\n30\\n00:04:58.830 --&gt; 00:05:07.560\\nruss altman: So those data sets, they were able to combine and figure out that that was the governor. Now, could they do this for everybody. Well,\\n\\n31\\n00:05:07.800 --&gt; 00:05:25.980\\nruss altman: Not routinely because we all don&#x27;t have our visits to the doctor put into the Boston Globe, but we all do certain things on Facebook or whatever that might give somebody a clue that would allow them to re identify a data set that otherwise seemed like it might be private and de identified\\n\\n32\\n00:05:27.690 --&gt; 00:05:39.720\\nruss altman: The same researcher went on to show that there&#x27;s a problem in the medical literature with rare diseases. So they, in this case, they went to the New England Journal of Medicine, you know, one of the fanciest medical research journals.\\n\\n33\\n00:05:40.740 --&gt; 00:05:52.320\\nruss altman: And they had like the University of Chicago. I believe had done a study on a rare disease and they had included DNA sequence in in the article.\\n\\n34\\n00:05:53.490 --&gt; 00:06:06.810\\nruss altman: And it was long enough so that it had lots of these snips. Now, my colleague by the way this is Tanya Sweeney, who now. I think I don&#x27;t know where she is now. She had, she had been at MIT. She went to\\n\\n35\\n00:06:08.940 --&gt; 00:06:14.220\\nruss altman: She went to Penn and I think she might be at Harvard. I&#x27;m confused about where she is. But she&#x27;s great.\\n\\n36\\n00:06:15.810 --&gt; 00:06:24.870\\nruss altman: She figured that well let&#x27;s just look at the Chicago area probably people who go to the University of Chicago. Medical Center are in the Chicago area.\\n\\n37\\n00:06:25.080 --&gt; 00:06:33.240\\nruss altman: So, and this is a rare disease. So when she went to the public health records. There was not hundreds and hundreds of people with these diseases, there was like four\\n\\n38\\n00:06:33.630 --&gt; 00:06:45.210\\nruss altman: And then they sit the in the in the New England Journal article the the investigators had also said, oh, and this is a five year old little girl when I, you know, five year old little girl rare diagnosis.\\n\\n39\\n00:06:46.140 --&gt; 00:06:53.430\\nruss altman: Now you know some of that girls little DNA sequence know her DNA was perfectly normal size of the little girl was little.\\n\\n40\\n00:06:54.090 --&gt; 00:07:03.330\\nruss altman: But, you know, now who that patient probably was. Now, of course, my colleague didn&#x27;t do anything nefarious with its information, but she did publish\\n\\n41\\n00:07:03.720 --&gt; 00:07:13.530\\nruss altman: On the fact that there are these risks that people are taking that they might not fully realize when they provide data in such a way that it could be\\n\\n42\\n00:07:14.460 --&gt; 00:07:24.900\\nruss altman: Used to re identify subjects we always ask or we like to think that we always ask patients if we can use their data for research and we&#x27;re very grateful when they consent.\\n\\n43\\n00:07:25.830 --&gt; 00:07:38.940\\nruss altman: But part of that consent is usually a some sort of guarantee that their identity will be kept private and now there&#x27;s a real question about whether you should make a guarantee.\\n\\n44\\n00:07:39.660 --&gt; 00:07:49.920\\nruss altman: Versus just say we&#x27;re going to make best effort to keep your identity private. But these kinds of things can happen. And we would be lying if we said that we can absolutely guaranteed privacy.\\n\\n45\\n00:07:52.170 --&gt; 00:07:56.490\\nruss altman: So we wrote a paper about this, as I said, this is now super old 16 years old.\\n\\n46\\n00:07:58.380 --&gt; 00:08:06.810\\nruss altman: ardo and isn&#x27;t statistics here Jen was a graduate student and we talked about this trade off between genomic research and human subject privacy.\\n\\n47\\n00:08:07.350 --&gt; 00:08:18.960\\nruss altman: So this is the paper where we did the calculation that 60 to 100 snips are basically unique any 60 to 100 snips are basically unique for a person\\n\\n48\\n00:08:19.650 --&gt; 00:08:33.660\\nruss altman: And then we wrote it up as a Policy Forum, because although they liked our scientific finding they thought the more important message might be about what does this mean for a policy about genetic genetic privacy.\\n\\n49\\n00:08:35.190 --&gt; 00:08:47.280\\nruss altman: So here is the EU, I have to delete some of that some of that writing here is the main graph which we came up with it is extremely simple but they liked it.\\n\\n50\\n00:08:48.450 --&gt; 00:08:53.550\\nruss altman: On the x axis. It&#x27;s the number of snips that are measured\\n\\n51\\n00:08:54.960 --&gt; 00:09:02.700\\nruss altman: And on the y axis is a, I would say a qualitative metric of privacy being low, medium, and high\\n\\n52\\n00:09:03.420 --&gt; 00:09:15.150\\nruss altman: Not my most quantitative moment of my career, but what we showed is if you want high privacy. You can only release tiny, tiny amounts of your DNA for any kind of guarantee\\n\\n53\\n00:09:15.600 --&gt; 00:09:21.600\\nruss altman: And as soon as you get up to 100 snips or beyond your privacy is low.\\n\\n54\\n00:09:22.080 --&gt; 00:09:39.030\\nruss altman: But that is precisely where we are going to make discoveries. So we really want to be out here to the far right, which means we have a problem with our guarantees of privacy, which we really should not make and that was the main point of that article.\\n\\n55\\n00:09:43.650 --&gt; 00:09:58.170\\nruss altman: So then comes my one of my favorite stories. I was giving a talk like this, but I didn&#x27;t have a great example of anybody actually using genetic information to re identify and then there was this great story and the, what is that UK\\n\\n56\\n00:09:59.280 --&gt; 00:10:12.180\\nruss altman: That London based, I want to say, The Daily Mail or the or the Guardian one of those had this great story about a teenager in the UK who figured out who his sperm donor father was\\n\\n57\\n00:10:13.080 --&gt; 00:10:29.730\\nruss altman: This team was my hero. So the father donate sperm anonymously 15 years ago he gets some money and they tell him that he will be forever anonymous. The only thing they&#x27;re ever going to give out. And this was their huge mistake was they were going to give out\\n\\n58\\n00:10:31.980 --&gt; 00:10:32.580\\nruss altman: Whoops.\\n\\n59\\n00:10:34.230 --&gt; 00:10:36.150\\nruss altman: The county where he was born.\\n\\n60\\n00:10:37.380 --&gt; 00:10:47.010\\nruss altman: And the year of his birth, and he said, Okay, you know that I come from a very populated County. And there was also many people born that year. Sounds Okay.\\n\\n61\\n00:10:47.520 --&gt; 00:10:57.450\\nruss altman: All right, so a woman gets a sperm donation has a baby baby grows up to be a teenager and is interested in his heritage and also and also smart.\\n\\n62\\n00:11:01.170 --&gt; 00:11:07.650\\nruss altman: There is a company that will use a commercial kid to look at your just your Y chromosome.\\n\\n63\\n00:11:09.150 --&gt; 00:11:19.560\\nruss altman: To tell you which version of the Y chromosome. You have now I will remind you that you get your Y chromosome from your biological father\\n\\n64\\n00:11:20.100 --&gt; 00:11:34.350\\nruss altman: And the kid knew this. So he said, Okay, I&#x27;m gonna find out about my Y chromosome that doesn&#x27;t tell you who your father is you know there&#x27;s 30 or 40 or 50 Y chromosome types, but obviously there&#x27;s a lot of people. However, this website.\\n\\n65\\n00:11:35.520 --&gt; 00:11:47.370\\nruss altman: This company had a website where if you gave up your last name, it would tell you other men who had the same pattern or variation in their Y chromosome. Now, you\\n\\n66\\n00:11:48.600 --&gt; 00:11:57.600\\nruss altman: The other thing you get from your dad in a petrol lineal society is their last name, which is which is what the UK is and was for the most part.\\n\\n67\\n00:11:58.320 --&gt; 00:12:07.170\\nruss altman: So this young man figured out that even if his biological father had not done this Y chromosome analysis.\\n\\n68\\n00:12:07.440 --&gt; 00:12:15.630\\nruss altman: There might be other people from that same family tree with the same Y chromosome, who would share the same last name.\\n\\n69\\n00:12:15.990 --&gt; 00:12:22.980\\nruss altman: So the kid got on the website gave his last name, which was irrelevant. It was whatever his mother&#x27;s or his adoptive father&#x27;s name was\\n\\n70\\n00:12:23.550 --&gt; 00:12:44.880\\nruss altman: But what he found out was all the names associated with that Y chromosome, and he could take the most common one and figure out, ah, this last name that that I&#x27;m seeing most commonly with this Y chromosome is probably my biological father&#x27;s last name. Oh, did we freeze.\\n\\n71\\n00:12:46.800 --&gt; 00:12:53.070\\nruss altman: I think we froze. So I&#x27;m going to stop here and restart because I don&#x27;t want to redo this part of the lecture.\\n\\n72\\n00:12:54.510 --&gt; 00:12:58.380\\nruss altman: But he figured out his last name.\\n\\n73\\n00:12:59.460 --&gt; 00:13:07.680\\nruss altman: Now he knew the county, the year M. The last name. He looked in the phone book he found two people with the same pattern.\\n\\n74\\n00:13:07.980 --&gt; 00:13:16.410\\nruss altman: He called one of them and said, Are you my father. And the guy said, I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about, and hung up, and he called the other one instead. Are you my father, and there was a long pause.\\n\\n75\\n00:13:16.920 --&gt; 00:13:24.510\\nruss altman: Bingo. You found your father, so he can find the he can find the information about age region of birth and year\\n\\n76\\n00:13:25.050 --&gt; 00:13:35.790\\nruss altman: To contact his father, so he really identified this guy who 15 YEARS AGO. GAVE sperm and thought he would never hear about it again, great example. And I&#x27;ll be back with the rest of the module.\\n\\n&quot;, &#x27;GMT20200407-010344_BioE-131-M.transcript.txt&#x27;: &quot;WEBVTT\\n\\n1\\n00:00:02.429 --&gt; 00:00:04.859\\nruss altman: Welcome to Module 11 hello, David.\\n\\n2\\n00:00:05.370 --&gt; 00:00:06.089\\nA Ross.\\n\\n3\\n00:00:07.500 --&gt; 00:00:08.099\\nDavid Magnus: Ready.\\n\\n4\\n00:00:08.610 --&gt; 00:00:13.290\\nDavid Magnus: Away. Today we&#x27;re gonna be talking about the uses of blood spots in research.\\n\\n5\\n00:00:15.120 --&gt; 00:00:27.300\\nDavid Magnus: So California law currently allows a theoretically parents to opt out, but almost none of them know that they can opt out of the uses for research. So in practice they don&#x27;t really have any option.\\n\\n6\\n00:00:28.350 --&gt; 00:00:38.460\\nDavid Magnus: There are people who make a lot of arguments, both in favor and against obtaining consent from people for allowing their uses and research and we&#x27;re going to just summarize some of those arguments.\\n\\n7\\n00:00:40.080 --&gt; 00:00:48.480\\nDavid Magnus: So first of all, there are some regulatory arguments against using a blood spots without consent first\\n\\n8\\n00:00:49.140 --&gt; 00:00:59.130\\nDavid Magnus: How is it even possible to use tissue from somebody without their consent. Well, the law allows the use of of material.\\n\\n9\\n00:00:59.790 --&gt; 00:01:08.580\\nDavid Magnus: As long as it&#x27;s de identified. So as long as the researchers don&#x27;t know who it&#x27;s from. Then under the current regulations that require that we get\\n\\n10\\n00:01:09.300 --&gt; 00:01:21.600\\nDavid Magnus: Informed consent for research, which we talked about earlier in the course, those regulations don&#x27;t apply because unless it&#x27;s identifiable. It doesn&#x27;t count as human subjects research.\\n\\n11\\n00:01:22.920 --&gt; 00:01:28.770\\nDavid Magnus: However, for this and this has really been the basis of why a lot of this blood spot. Research has taken place.\\n\\n12\\n00:01:29.010 --&gt; 00:01:37.890\\nDavid Magnus: However, and we&#x27;re going to be talking about this issue of re identification in much more detail in a future class, but the idea that you could have data.\\n\\n13\\n00:01:38.220 --&gt; 00:01:53.130\\nDavid Magnus: And especially genomic data and claim that it&#x27;s the identified has become increasingly problematic. And what that means is that the loophole in a way that people have been using to justify research without consent.\\n\\n14\\n00:01:54.630 --&gt; 00:01:56.730\\nDavid Magnus: Is getting harder and harder to maintain\\n\\n15\\n00:01:57.810 --&gt; 00:01:59.970\\nDavid Magnus: And some of the new regulations governing\\n\\n16\\n00:02:01.080 --&gt; 00:02:09.720\\nDavid Magnus: Research with blood spots explicitly says we should think of these things as identifiable therefore that loophole goes away.\\n\\n17\\n00:02:10.620 --&gt; 00:02:19.140\\nDavid Magnus: In addition to this regulatory argument. There&#x27;s also an ethical argument against using samples for research without consent.\\n\\n18\\n00:02:20.130 --&gt; 00:02:34.650\\nDavid Magnus: A lot of bioethicists have have done studies and surveys and they show that most of the public wants to be asked for permission before their samples are used. In fact, the people behind the campaigns in Minnesota.\\n\\n19\\n00:02:34.980 --&gt; 00:02:40.890\\nDavid Magnus: And in Texas that led to the destruction of their blood spots what the leaders all said was\\n\\n20\\n00:02:41.160 --&gt; 00:02:53.520\\nDavid Magnus: I would have consented, and let you use my blood spots, but doing it without buying permission is just wrong, and therefore I we bought these blood spot should be thrown out and you shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to do this unless you ask for permission first.\\n\\n21\\n00:02:55.860 --&gt; 00:02:58.650\\nDavid Magnus: privacy rights regarding control of this information.\\n\\n22\\n00:02:59.670 --&gt; 00:03:05.220\\nDavid Magnus: suggests a violation. So that&#x27;s the ontological concern that this is a violation of them as individuals.\\n\\n23\\n00:03:05.610 --&gt; 00:03:20.730\\nDavid Magnus: Moreover, it&#x27;s really important that the public have trust in the research community and we know that consent can play an important role in that process, a group of researchers led by Jeff Bob can have done a study of\\n\\n24\\n00:03:22.080 --&gt; 00:03:30.270\\nDavid Magnus: Of thinking about how what the best approach to this is when they looked at all the empirical studies of public attitudes parental attitudes.\\n\\n25\\n00:03:30.510 --&gt; 00:03:36.720\\nDavid Magnus: When they look at all the guideline statements from professional bodies as well as actual state policies.\\n\\n26\\n00:03:37.320 --&gt; 00:03:48.810\\nDavid Magnus: They use that as a basis for an expert working group and the result was that they made some recommendations, though most people when you ask them prefer opt in consent, where you actually say Can I have permission.\\n\\n27\\n00:03:49.590 --&gt; 00:03:57.030\\nDavid Magnus: The group concluded that opt out consent was justifiable, that is, you would still ask for permission but the default\\n\\n28\\n00:03:57.930 --&gt; 00:04:09.000\\nDavid Magnus: Would be that they would that they were presumed to be in the research, unless they explicitly said, I don&#x27;t want to be a part of it. And this creates a little bit of a nudge using trace art, architecture in favor of it.\\n\\n29\\n00:04:09.540 --&gt; 00:04:15.060\\nruss altman: Just compose there. I believe there&#x27;s a ton of data that you get very different\\n\\n30\\n00:04:15.750 --&gt; 00:04:26.940\\nruss altman: numbers of people signing up in opt in versus opt out. So even though, in theory, saying opt in or opt out should lead to the same number, depending if you&#x27;re making your decisions solely on your preferences.\\n\\n31\\n00:04:27.480 --&gt; 00:04:36.360\\nruss altman: There&#x27;s a literature that shows that when you opt in, you get if it&#x27;s automatic opt in, you get way less people than if you automatically opt them out.\\n\\n32\\n00:04:36.870 --&gt; 00:04:46.980\\nDavid Magnus: That&#x27;s correct. That&#x27;s really why choice architecture and and preset preferences really work to have a different have an impact on on on people&#x27;s behavior.\\n\\n33\\n00:04:48.120 --&gt; 00:04:55.350\\nDavid Magnus: But, of course, the more robust that the opt out consent is, the more it gets like opt in.\\n\\n34\\n00:04:55.620 --&gt; 00:04:57.360\\nDavid Magnus: Then the less that impact has\\n\\n35\\n00:04:58.860 --&gt; 00:05:02.760\\nDavid Magnus: So, and, and one of the things that some of the researchers found is\\n\\n36\\n00:05:03.000 --&gt; 00:05:10.170\\nDavid Magnus: People who said, I think I should opt in. When explained why they didn&#x27;t think that was a good idea because you wouldn&#x27;t have robust enough numbers.\\n\\n37\\n00:05:10.380 --&gt; 00:05:23.340\\nDavid Magnus: The data wouldn&#x27;t be as useful. And what if we did a really robust opt out. Most people come around to saying opt out would be okay. And so that&#x27;s more or less the majority view in the bioethics community.\\n\\n38\\n00:05:23.820 --&gt; 00:05:30.060\\nDavid Magnus: But there are some important arguments in favor of using even unscented blood spots and maybe not requiring consent.\\n\\n39\\n00:05:31.410 --&gt; 00:05:39.240\\nDavid Magnus: Obviously, currently, it doesn&#x27;t count as human subjects under the regulations. If it&#x27;s the identified, but we&#x27;ve already seen that that may be problematic.\\n\\n40\\n00:05:40.380 --&gt; 00:05:49.830\\nDavid Magnus: But what some other arguments in favor include the fact that to some extent there, whether you consent or not. There has to be some research like activities.\\n\\n41\\n00:05:50.160 --&gt; 00:05:57.540\\nDavid Magnus: With blood spots, whether there&#x27;s consent or not. And that&#x27;s because even be to be able to order to use them for clinical purposes.\\n\\n42\\n00:05:57.810 --&gt; 00:06:06.570\\nDavid Magnus: You have to have quality assurance and quality improvement activities that take place on a regular basis to make sure that the test really work the way you think they do.\\n\\n43\\n00:06:06.870 --&gt; 00:06:17.820\\nDavid Magnus: And you, there is no way of opting out of that. So a very research like activity has to take place anyway, even without research and that QA QA work is\\n\\n44\\n00:06:18.510 --&gt; 00:06:28.110\\nDavid Magnus: Is outside of the regulatory system and so is allowed to be done. Moreover, the one of the worries that a lot of people have about creating even an opt out.\\n\\n45\\n00:06:28.830 --&gt; 00:06:41.760\\nDavid Magnus: consent process is that you will have less people in the databases and that that will lead to both less data less robust data and, especially, there&#x27;s a concern that that data may become\\n\\n46\\n00:06:42.180 --&gt; 00:06:53.610\\nDavid Magnus: wider and more educated and more middle class, middle class to athletes, because in general when you require consent even opt out consent, you wind up getting\\n\\n47\\n00:06:54.060 --&gt; 00:07:05.340\\nDavid Magnus: More people who are white signing up for research and you end up having less ethnic and racial minorities in groups that are underrepresented in research traditionally be included.\\n\\n48\\n00:07:06.630 --&gt; 00:07:08.700\\nDavid Magnus: Our colleague Carlos Bustamante\\n\\n49\\n00:07:09.780 --&gt; 00:07:11.130\\nDavid Magnus: This was must have been about\\n\\n50\\n00:07:12.210 --&gt; 00:07:21.780\\nDavid Magnus: Something like around eight or 10 years ago looked at genome wide association studies and at that time they were almost all done on people of European descent.\\n\\n51\\n00:07:22.110 --&gt; 00:07:28.020\\nDavid Magnus: A few years later, it got a little bit better in the US, but it was still about 96% or 94%\\n\\n52\\n00:07:28.890 --&gt; 00:07:37.230\\nDavid Magnus: From people of European descent in the research in the US and up until I would say, up until now there&#x27;s efforts to try to improve that with things like the\\n\\n53\\n00:07:37.530 --&gt; 00:07:53.940\\nDavid Magnus: All of us research program, but the truth is that most research repositories remain mostly middle class educated white people, which we know already know a lot about. And when you increase the consent requirements you make the the data more biased.\\n\\n54\\n00:07:54.330 --&gt; 00:08:00.480\\nruss altman: And saying if those underrepresented groups don&#x27;t trust the Healthcare Research Establishment\\n\\n55\\n00:08:01.620 --&gt; 00:08:06.090\\nruss altman: Is it really the right thing to do, to say, well, we&#x27;re going to take that choice away from you.\\n\\n56\\n00:08:06.390 --&gt; 00:08:10.500\\nDavid Magnus: So that&#x27;s a really great question. And that really relates to the question of really\\n\\n57\\n00:08:11.100 --&gt; 00:08:16.920\\nDavid Magnus: What establishes trust. And so the people who want to defend the unconsidered blood spots.\\n\\n58\\n00:08:17.220 --&gt; 00:08:26.460\\nDavid Magnus: Are skeptical that informed consent forms and a few lines and informed consent form that people barely read and sign or refuse to sign\\n\\n59\\n00:08:26.760 --&gt; 00:08:36.720\\nDavid Magnus: Really is a very powerful way of demonstrating respect for the research participants and that will we need to do is keep these people included in the research.\\n\\n60\\n00:08:36.960 --&gt; 00:08:50.160\\nDavid Magnus: Because unconsidered blood spots are the most diverse databases that we have for lunch genomic point of view, but to actually find other more meaningful ways of demonstrating respect for those populations.\\n\\n61\\n00:08:50.790 --&gt; 00:09:00.990\\nDavid Magnus: Rather than relying on a few lot you know a few maybe even just a few paragraphs of an informed consent form that&#x27;s probably not understand unless they&#x27;re their lawyers.\\n\\n62\\n00:09:01.920 --&gt; 00:09:08.970\\nDavid Magnus: There&#x27;s no evidence that anybody has ever been harmed. As a result of a stored sample for decades. So the risk is low.\\n\\n63\\n00:09:09.420 --&gt; 00:09:15.870\\nDavid Magnus: And another thing that&#x27;s really important is that there&#x27;s evidence that people do value the research.\\n\\n64\\n00:09:16.380 --&gt; 00:09:22.020\\nDavid Magnus: That&#x27;s being done. So on the one hand, we want to respect the fact that people are saying, I want to give consent.\\n\\n65\\n00:09:22.350 --&gt; 00:09:30.000\\nDavid Magnus: But people are also saying when you give those people surveys. I want there to be a robust database of research and for this research to take place.\\n\\n66\\n00:09:30.240 --&gt; 00:09:38.820\\nDavid Magnus: The same surveys show that very clearly and what&#x27;s happened is that the bioethics community has basically said we&#x27;re going to give priority to one preference over another.\\n\\n67\\n00:09:39.120 --&gt; 00:09:46.860\\nDavid Magnus: But people don&#x27;t really ask that question, so they don&#x27;t ask the people like well you want the research to take place and you also want to give consent.\\n\\n68\\n00:09:47.070 --&gt; 00:09:53.490\\nDavid Magnus: But those two things may be incompatible, to some extent, and if they don&#x27;t fit together. Which do you think is more important.\\n\\n69\\n00:09:53.760 --&gt; 00:10:01.620\\nDavid Magnus: That turns out to be very hard to study, it&#x27;s not been studied very much but we&#x27;ve gotten some surprising answers when we&#x27;ve tried to explore some of those issues.\\n\\n70\\n00:10:01.860 --&gt; 00:10:12.510\\nDavid Magnus: In a study that we did, we found that 70% of people said they&#x27;d be willing to forgo consent or or lower the consent requirements in order for research to be possible.\\n\\n71\\n00:10:12.780 --&gt; 00:10:17.790\\nruss altman: Let me just say that my pen just ran out of ink. So we&#x27;re on our own from here on out. But keep going.\\n\\n72\\n00:10:18.060 --&gt; 00:10:33.720\\nDavid Magnus: Okay, so I&#x27;ll just say that one of the other challenges is when you ask people for consent. If it&#x27;s very specific consent about each particular research project that really becomes impossible and would make the research databases useless.\\n\\n73\\n00:10:34.740 --&gt; 00:10:35.670\\nDavid Magnus: There you go. Got it back.\\n\\n74\\n00:10:36.390 --&gt; 00:10:38.220\\nruss altman: I unplugged it and plugged it back in.\\n\\n75\\n00:10:38.520 --&gt; 00:10:49.740\\nDavid Magnus: Okay, there we go. So, so, so, so, so specific consent really would make the research unusable because you couldn&#x27;t ask. Go, go back to\\n\\n76\\n00:10:50.040 --&gt; 00:10:56.550\\nDavid Magnus: The database. Go back to, to all the blood spots and try and track everybody down for every time a researcher wanted to use this\\n\\n77\\n00:10:56.790 --&gt; 00:11:05.400\\nDavid Magnus: Which would mean that if you were going to have consent at all. It would have to be a very broad consent, which, again, if you&#x27;re thinking about this as a way of demonstrating respect telling them.\\n\\n78\\n00:11:05.760 --&gt; 00:11:13.350\\nDavid Magnus: We&#x27;re going to do use your blood spots for research. We don&#x27;t know exactly what&#x27;s going to be done with them, they&#x27;ll be some kind of genomic or genetic analysis done\\n\\n79\\n00:11:13.620 --&gt; 00:11:21.360\\nDavid Magnus: We can&#x27;t really predict what it&#x27;s going to be, it doesn&#x27;t really tell you very much. If you have broad consent and and yet.\\n\\n80\\n00:11:22.560 --&gt; 00:11:32.880\\nDavid Magnus: If you don&#x27;t, if you try to, as I said, have specific consent for every research project, then it would actually make the research absolutely impossible to take place.\\n\\n81\\n00:11:33.810 --&gt; 00:11:40.050\\nDavid Magnus: So cheer, there&#x27;s a trade off. People want to give consent. They want the research to take place and they want to reap its benefits.\\n\\n82\\n00:11:40.830 --&gt; 00:11:48.450\\nDavid Magnus: So studying this issue is really something that we need to do more of to see what people think of, but we also need to be\\n\\n83\\n00:11:49.080 --&gt; 00:11:57.990\\nDavid Magnus: Aware of what our options are for trying to have data that&#x27;s truly diverse and useful for researchers\\n\\n84\\n00:11:58.560 --&gt; 00:12:04.770\\nDavid Magnus: While also being respectful to participants. There&#x27;s one last wrinkle. I just want to mention, and that is\\n\\n85\\n00:12:05.550 --&gt; 00:12:17.400\\nDavid Magnus: So far we&#x27;ve been talking about this in the US context, but at least some other countries, and there&#x27;s always the potential in this country as well that there could be negative associations with some of this. So for example, in China.\\n\\n86\\n00:12:17.910 --&gt; 00:12:26.610\\nDavid Magnus: Police collected biometric information and samples of 19 million people who were being a press who are Muslims\\n\\n87\\n00:12:27.570 --&gt; 00:12:30.480\\nDavid Magnus: And using some of these technologies to try and figure out\\n\\n88\\n00:12:31.170 --&gt; 00:12:38.670\\nDavid Magnus: Who, who, people were from their DNA and to try and figure out facial patterns that they would expect to see what people would look like from their DNA.\\n\\n89\\n00:12:38.940 --&gt; 00:12:53.250\\nDavid Magnus: So they could identify them from seeing them in crowds and things like that. So there&#x27;s definitely the potential that this technology could be abused by the state or by other commercial entities and so we need to be aware of the fact that that that\\n\\n90\\n00:12:54.300 --&gt; 00:13:12.630\\nDavid Magnus: Doing this in a respectful manner requires that the uses of it be protected and some of the mechanisms for doing that include things like having really important and good governance and oversight of this research so that these kinds of uses. Don&#x27;t take place.\\n\\n91\\n00:13:14.100 --&gt; 00:13:15.000\\nDavid Magnus: And that&#x27;s it.\\n\\n92\\n00:13:15.870 --&gt; 00:13:23.160\\nruss altman: That was it. Thank you very much, the issues related to using blood spots for research. Sorry about the little pen.\\n\\n93\\n00:13:24.300 --&gt; 00:13:29.010\\nruss altman: Issue, but we will stop the share and we will stop the meeting. Thanks.\\n\\n&quot;}})\n",

This is the second part of module 22 which froze in my PowerPoint. So you just heard the story about the team who found his father in the UK and US became my hero as a early case of DNA re identification.\\n\\n2\\n00:00:21.390 --&gt; 00:00:37.980\\nruss altman: The next thing I want to tell you about, which is worrisome is this idea of identifying individuals for in a mixture. It had been widely assumed that if you have like 1000 people&#x27;s DNA in a mixture and this was somebody studied this because of forensics. Let&#x27;s say you have a\\n\\n3\\n00:00:39.180 --&gt; 00:00:43.140\\nruss altman: Person who&#x27;s not allowed to go to children&#x27;s parks, because they were a sex offender.\\n\\n4\\n00:00:44.490 --&gt; 00:00:56.880\\nruss altman: And you collected DNA at the park. There&#x27;s no way you would be able to figure out if that person was one of the people who had been at that park and left some of their DNA that was an assumption which turned out to be wrong, and in\\n\\n5\\n00:00:58.350 --&gt; 00:01:05.820\\nruss altman: Homer at all published a paper showing that if you have the genome, the genetics of a single individual.\\n\\n6\\n00:01:06.810 --&gt; 00:01:19.320\\nruss altman: And they don&#x27;t even need the whole genome. They just need about a million snips and you can measure a million snips for like 200 bucks 23andMe does a million snips as part of their $99 genetic\\n\\n7\\n00:01:20.430 --&gt; 00:01:36.090\\nruss altman: rundown. So if you can have a million snips for a single individual. And then you have a mixture of 1000 individuals and you want to know is my individual part of that mixture, you can determine that with extremely high confidence.\\n\\n8\\n00:01:37.140 --&gt; 00:01:41.610\\nruss altman: That was a surprise to people. And I just want to give you a sense for how where it comes from.\\n\\n9\\n00:01:44.190 --&gt; 00:01:55.260\\nruss altman: Okay I froze again and that irritates me so I&#x27;m just going to stop the share and restart the share hoping that that solves this problem apologize for this.\\n\\n10\\n00:02:01.260 --&gt; 00:02:03.750\\nruss altman: All right, let&#x27;s see if we can go to the next slide.\\n\\n11\\n00:02:13.050 --&gt; 00:02:18.510\\nruss altman: I do not want to draw that much I mostly want to get in back into my lecture, please.\\n\\n12\\n00:02:23.250 --&gt; 00:02:26.040\\nruss altman: So bush league Ross.\\n\\n13\\n00:02:27.120 --&gt; 00:02:37.830\\nruss altman: How did they do it statistics. So they have a million measurements of the invalid individual, for example, there&#x27;s an A deposition 3432\\n\\n14\\n00:02:39.570 --&gt; 00:02:45.030\\nruss altman: So let&#x27;s assume that 10% of all people in the general population have an A and 90% of a tea.\\n\\n15\\n00:02:45.750 --&gt; 00:03:09.810\\nruss altman: Now you have a million measurements of a mixture of 1000 other people have a mixture of 1000 people from that population. Okay, so let&#x27;s say that in those thousand people. There&#x27;s a 15% rate of a, an attempt at 5% rate of tea at that same position. Now our person had an A at at that position.\\n\\n16\\n00:03:11.250 --&gt; 00:03:14.340\\nruss altman: And you&#x27;re seeing slightly more A&#x27;s.\\n\\n17\\n00:03:15.690 --&gt; 00:03:20.310\\nruss altman: In the mixture than you are in the population at large.\\n\\n18\\n00:03:21.360 --&gt; 00:03:22.320\\nruss altman: Versus 10\\n\\n19\\n00:03:23.370 --&gt; 00:03:34.590\\nruss altman: So this person could have contributed that slight bit of extra a to the mixture does approve anything. Absolutely not.\\n\\n20\\n00:03:34.980 --&gt; 00:03:47.040\\nruss altman: First of all, they could not be in the mixture. Second of all, they could not be contributing to the X ray, but it increases the chance that they were in the mixture a tiny, tiny, tiny bit.\\n\\n21\\n00:03:48.270 --&gt; 00:03:54.870\\nruss altman: Now, so it&#x27;s slightly more probable that that individual is in, then they&#x27;re out\\n\\n22\\n00:03:56.340 --&gt; 00:04:03.600\\nruss altman: Now this is where your intuition loses you though because we have a million such measurements.\\n\\n23\\n00:04:04.020 --&gt; 00:04:15.030\\nruss altman: So every one of these tiny things that&#x27;s either in favor or against the hypothesis that they&#x27;re in the mixture adds up. And it turns out that somewhere around\\n\\n24\\n00:04:15.900 --&gt; 00:04:27.330\\nruss altman: 200 300,000 of these measurements you are positive that that person is either in or out. And then the other 700,000 just serve to increase your certainty.\\n\\n25\\n00:04:28.770 --&gt; 00:04:40.770\\nruss altman: So that&#x27;s a that&#x27;s amazing and true and it showed that people&#x27;s intuitions about went about when DNA is safe in a mixture were wrong.\\n\\n26\\n00:04:41.190 --&gt; 00:04:44.430\\nruss altman: This cause shock waves throughout the National Institutes of Health.\\n\\n27\\n00:04:44.700 --&gt; 00:04:58.080\\nruss altman: Because they had databases, where they said, here is the summary data for 1000 people, they would say 15% 85% t and they thought they were fine. And they didn&#x27;t have to worry about anybody in that study being identified\\n\\n28\\n00:04:58.410 --&gt; 00:05:06.870\\nruss altman: But if you had the genome of one of those 1000 people you could run it through the NIH database. And you could figure out if that person.\\n\\n29\\n00:05:07.230 --&gt; 00:05:09.000\\nruss altman: Participated in a study or not.\\n\\n30\\n00:05:09.390 --&gt; 00:05:21.420\\nruss altman: Why would we care about this. Well, let&#x27;s say the person signed up for a study with a sensitive diagnosis. They were sensitive about the disease that they had, they didn&#x27;t really want the rest of the world to know or their ensures or their employers.\\n\\n31\\n00:05:21.660 --&gt; 00:05:27.930\\nruss altman: And now there&#x27;s a way for somebody to figure out if they&#x27;re part of that mixture and therefore if they might have that disease.\\n\\n32\\n00:05:30.030 --&gt; 00:05:41.940\\nruss altman: This became clear and there was a New York Times article in 2013 where they showed that people could use genetics, plus the state and their age to re identify people\\n\\n33\\n00:05:42.930 --&gt; 00:05:47.700\\nruss altman: And these kinds of articles now are routinely appearing in the New York Times, showing that\\n\\n34\\n00:05:48.180 --&gt; 00:06:10.800\\nruss altman: People&#x27;s assumptions about their privacy with respect to their DNA are in many cases wrong and we really as a society need to discuss what should be the rules. So I just want to leave you with this. I should have mentioned this before I want to tell you about a law. It&#x27;s called the genetic\\n\\n35\\n00:06:13.170 --&gt; 00:06:14.370\\nruss altman: Information\\n\\n36\\n00:06:17.760 --&gt; 00:06:21.780\\nruss altman: Non discrimination act on this.\\n\\n37\\n00:06:23.130 --&gt; 00:06:24.780\\nruss altman: Whoa, let&#x27;s, let&#x27;s, a\\n\\n38\\n00:06:28.170 --&gt; 00:06:31.050\\nruss altman: Non discrimination.\\n\\n39\\n00:06:32.490 --&gt; 00:06:34.320\\nruss altman: Act or Gina\\n\\n40\\n00:06:36.750 --&gt; 00:06:44.250\\nruss altman: Gina was passed to say that you cannot discriminate against people based on their genetic data because the genetic data.\\n\\n41\\n00:06:44.610 --&gt; 00:06:57.240\\nruss altman: Often is manipulating probabilities, but it&#x27;s not giving anything that&#x27;s definite, even if it is definite though it&#x27;s not clear that you should hold it against people in employment or other forms of\\n\\n42\\n00:06:59.190 --&gt; 00:07:07.950\\nruss altman: Of financial transactions Gina is a pretty good act, but it&#x27;s limited because it does not cover disability insurance.\\n\\n43\\n00:07:11.070 --&gt; 00:07:21.750\\nruss altman: And it does not cover life insurance so they can still they being the insurance companies can still discriminate you when they&#x27;re making decisions about life insurance or disability insurance.\\n\\n44\\n00:07:22.110 --&gt; 00:07:26.040\\nruss altman: But they can&#x27;t use it for health insurance. And so that&#x27;s a big one.\\n\\n45\\n00:07:26.730 --&gt; 00:07:32.790\\nruss altman: Because now pre existing genetic information can be used to raise your rates or deny health insurance.\\n\\n46\\n00:07:33.120 --&gt; 00:07:49.980\\nruss altman: So, Gina is imperfect, but it&#x27;s a step in the right direction. Many people think most people believe that we should get rid of these exceptions and maybe we&#x27;ll talk about it in class. Okay, that&#x27;s the end of this second half of module 22\\n\\n&quot;, &#x27;GMT20200420-171758_BioE-131-M.transcript.txt&#x27;: &quot;WEBVTT\\n\\n1\\n00:00:03.179 --&gt; 00:00:08.400\\nruss altman: A bio 131. This is Russ in module 22\\n\\n2\\n00:00:09.719 --&gt; 00:00:22.200\\nruss altman: Now this is not a tech briefing module, but this is Russ, so you&#x27;re not going to get the kind of deep ethical analysis that David usually gives but hopefully we will get you close to ethics.\\n\\n3\\n00:00:22.980 --&gt; 00:00:35.760\\nruss altman: So that we can have a good discussion in class. And so you can think about these things. So this is not being labeled a technical briefing module, but you&#x27;ll see that it has more of the flavor of technical stuff and less of the ethics stuff. So whatever\\n\\n4\\n00:00:36.420 --&gt; 00:00:42.000\\nruss altman: And I hope you&#x27;re all having a good hair day you know hair is becoming an issue for all of us without any haircuts being available and so\\n\\n5\\n00:00:42.900 --&gt; 00:00:56.490\\nruss altman: A re identify ability. This is the idea that people create databases that they think are secure and which cannot have any of the individual participants be re identify\\n\\n6\\n00:00:57.360 --&gt; 00:01:07.080\\nruss altman: And cannot have any of the participants identified, but it&#x27;s false, because bottom line for this module is that\\n\\n7\\n00:01:07.620 --&gt; 00:01:16.530\\nruss altman: Sets of databases can be combined to figure out who is in a database, even if an individual database seems to be secure.\\n\\n8\\n00:01:17.490 --&gt; 00:01:23.790\\nruss altman: So in the technical briefing module. I talked about pharmacogenomics. And this database farm GK be that we&#x27;re building and we got worried\\n\\n9\\n00:01:24.120 --&gt; 00:01:34.230\\nruss altman: Because we were a genetic database. We were supporting research and we had DNA from subjects and we also had phenotype data. Most of the phenotype data was how they responded to drugs.\\n\\n10\\n00:01:35.070 --&gt; 00:01:42.120\\nruss altman: As I said in the last module is about 10 million locations in the genome. And one of the calculations we did and we published this\\n\\n11\\n00:01:42.780 --&gt; 00:01:52.230\\nruss altman: Was that even though there are 10 million locations you only need 60 to 100 of these snips. Remember the snips, the single base pair switches\\n\\n12\\n00:01:52.680 --&gt; 00:02:03.480\\nruss altman: If you tell me 100 positions in your genome and which letter you have that&#x27;s enough typically for you to be unique, other than a\\n\\n13\\n00:02:04.470 --&gt; 00:02:16.380\\nruss altman: Other than a a identical twin. So that was a wake up call for everybody because it was like, wow, you don&#x27;t need a very big piece of DNA to make it like a fingerprint now.\\n\\n14\\n00:02:16.830 --&gt; 00:02:26.520\\nruss altman: The thing is just because you have the DNA and you sequence it and you know those hundred measurements that doesn&#x27;t tell you who the person is unless there&#x27;s another database.\\n\\n15\\n00:02:26.880 --&gt; 00:02:33.630\\nruss altman: That has either the person&#x27;s identification and their DNA. So you could match up the DNA and figure out who the person is\\n\\n16\\n00:02:34.140 --&gt; 00:02:43.860\\nruss altman: Or if it has enough information about that person without giving you their actual name. There&#x27;s enough information for you to figure out their name like\\n\\n17\\n00:02:44.460 --&gt; 00:02:57.630\\nruss altman: All of their geo locations over the last period of time or all of their purchases on Amazon. Again, not as easy as looking up a name. But if you are motivated and if you have a lot of data, you may be able to figure out who they are.\\n\\n18\\n00:02:57.960 --&gt; 00:03:01.890\\nruss altman: And this is what this is about, particularly in the context of genetic data.\\n\\n19\\n00:03:02.700 --&gt; 00:03:13.710\\nruss altman: So as I said, if the genetic data can be associated with the phenotype data, then you might be able to figure out who&#x27;s in a study and I&#x27;ll give you some examples. So we can make it real.\\n\\n20\\n00:03:14.190 --&gt; 00:03:28.620\\nruss altman: In fact, there are examples before DNA was a thing or before it was, you know, measured routinely. There&#x27;s a couple of great cases. My favorite case is the governor of Massachusetts. Well, this was about 20 years ago.\\n\\n21\\n00:03:29.850 --&gt; 00:03:42.480\\nruss altman: He released public health records. And he said, This is great. He said, We&#x27;re going to catalyze research and public health. We&#x27;ve removed all the names and birthdays and addresses.\\n\\n22\\n00:03:43.350 --&gt; 00:03:46.500\\nruss altman: Detailed addresses so you don&#x27;t have to worry about your privacy.\\n\\n23\\n00:03:47.490 --&gt; 00:03:55.680\\nruss altman: And of course, Massachusetts is the home for Harvard Medical School and many other medical schools, and this was going to be a great thing for Massachusetts to have this great data set.\\n\\n24\\n00:03:56.100 --&gt; 00:04:08.820\\nruss altman: Well, three days after governor weld released this data, a researcher at MIT, who was a privacy expert sent governor weld medical records to the Boston Globe.\\n\\n25\\n00:04:09.840 --&gt; 00:04:11.760\\nruss altman: In a beautiful, beautiful moment.\\n\\n26\\n00:04:12.930 --&gt; 00:04:23.940\\nruss altman: And so what did they do well. It was true that the names and addresses had been removed, but they showed that they could use the voter ID roles which are public.\\n\\n27\\n00:04:24.270 --&gt; 00:04:27.090\\nruss altman: And the Department of Motor Vehicle roles which are public.\\n\\n28\\n00:04:27.390 --&gt; 00:04:40.830\\nruss altman: To figure out governor welds age his birthday, where he lives and then the one other thing they had was, they actually the Boston Globe itself had published at peace, saying that the governor had been to the doctor on a certain day\\n\\n29\\n00:04:41.070 --&gt; 00:04:57.450\\nruss altman: And had a clean bill of health. It was like a little public interest piece, but then they knew at least one day when somebody of Governor weld age and in his neighborhood went to a physician that generated a bill and with all of that and the bill was in the public health data.\\n\\n30\\n00:04:58.830 --&gt; 00:05:07.560\\nruss altman: So those data sets, they were able to combine and figure out that that was the governor. Now, could they do this for everybody. Well,\\n\\n31\\n00:05:07.800 --&gt; 00:05:25.980\\nruss altman: Not routinely because we all don&#x27;t have our visits to the doctor put into the Boston Globe, but we all do certain things on Facebook or whatever that might give somebody a clue that would allow them to re identify a data set that otherwise seemed like it might be private and de identified\\n\\n32\\n00:05:27.690 --&gt; 00:05:39.720\\nruss altman: The same researcher went on to show that there&#x27;s a problem in the medical literature with rare diseases. So they, in this case, they went to the New England Journal of Medicine, you know, one of the fanciest medical research journals.\\n\\n33\\n00:05:40.740 --&gt; 00:05:52.320\\nruss altman: And they had like the University of Chicago. I believe had done a study on a rare disease and they had included DNA sequence in in the article.\\n\\n34\\n00:05:53.490 --&gt; 00:06:06.810\\nruss altman: And it was long enough so that it had lots of these snips. Now, my colleague by the way this is Tanya Sweeney, who now. I think I don&#x27;t know where she is now. She had, she had been at MIT. She went to\\n\\n35\\n00:06:08.940 --&gt; 00:06:14.220\\nruss altman: She went to Penn and I think she might be at Harvard. I&#x27;m confused about where she is. But she&#x27;s great.\\n\\n36\\n00:06:15.810 --&gt; 00:06:24.870\\nruss altman: She figured that well let&#x27;s just look at the Chicago area probably people who go to the University of Chicago. Medical Center are in the Chicago area.\\n\\n37\\n00:06:25.080 --&gt; 00:06:33.240\\nruss altman: So, and this is a rare disease. So when she went to the public health records. There was not hundreds and hundreds of people with these diseases, there was like four\\n\\n38\\n00:06:33.630 --&gt; 00:06:45.210\\nruss altman: And then they sit the in the in the New England Journal article the the investigators had also said, oh, and this is a five year old little girl when I, you know, five year old little girl rare diagnosis.\\n\\n39\\n00:06:46.140 --&gt; 00:06:53.430\\nruss altman: Now you know some of that girls little DNA sequence know her DNA was perfectly normal size of the little girl was little.\\n\\n40\\n00:06:54.090 --&gt; 00:07:03.330\\nruss altman: But, you know, now who that patient probably was. Now, of course, my colleague didn&#x27;t do anything nefarious with its information, but she did publish\\n\\n41\\n00:07:03.720 --&gt; 00:07:13.530\\nruss altman: On the fact that there are these risks that people are taking that they might not fully realize when they provide data in such a way that it could be\\n\\n42\\n00:07:14.460 --&gt; 00:07:24.900\\nruss altman: Used to re identify subjects we always ask or we like to think that we always ask patients if we can use their data for research and we&#x27;re very grateful when they consent.\\n\\n43\\n00:07:25.830 --&gt; 00:07:38.940\\nruss altman: But part of that consent is usually a some sort of guarantee that their identity will be kept private and now there&#x27;s a real question about whether you should make a guarantee.\\n\\n44\\n00:07:39.660 --&gt; 00:07:49.920\\nruss altman: Versus just say we&#x27;re going to make best effort to keep your identity private. But these kinds of things can happen. And we would be lying if we said that we can absolutely guaranteed privacy.\\n\\n45\\n00:07:52.170 --&gt; 00:07:56.490\\nruss altman: So we wrote a paper about this, as I said, this is now super old 16 years old.\\n\\n46\\n00:07:58.380 --&gt; 00:08:06.810\\nruss altman: ardo and isn&#x27;t statistics here Jen was a graduate student and we talked about this trade off between genomic research and human subject privacy.\\n\\n47\\n00:08:07.350 --&gt; 00:08:18.960\\nruss altman: So this is the paper where we did the calculation that 60 to 100 snips are basically unique any 60 to 100 snips are basically unique for a person\\n\\n48\\n00:08:19.650 --&gt; 00:08:33.660\\nruss altman: And then we wrote it up as a Policy Forum, because although they liked our scientific finding they thought the more important message might be about what does this mean for a policy about genetic genetic privacy.\\n\\n49\\n00:08:35.190 --&gt; 00:08:47.280\\nruss altman: So here is the EU, I have to delete some of that some of that writing here is the main graph which we came up with it is extremely simple but they liked it.\\n\\n50\\n00:08:48.450 --&gt; 00:08:53.550\\nruss altman: On the x axis. It&#x27;s the number of snips that are measured\\n\\n51\\n00:08:54.960 --&gt; 00:09:02.700\\nruss altman: And on the y axis is a, I would say a qualitative metric of privacy being low, medium, and high\\n\\n52\\n00:09:03.420 --&gt; 00:09:15.150\\nruss altman: Not my most quantitative moment of my career, but what we showed is if you want high privacy. You can only release tiny, tiny amounts of your DNA for any kind of guarantee\\n\\n53\\n00:09:15.600 --&gt; 00:09:21.600\\nruss altman: And as soon as you get up to 100 snips or beyond your privacy is low.\\n\\n54\\n00:09:22.080 --&gt; 00:09:39.030\\nruss altman: But that is precisely where we are going to make discoveries. So we really want to be out here to the far right, which means we have a problem with our guarantees of privacy, which we really should not make and that was the main point of that article.\\n\\n55\\n00:09:43.650 --&gt; 00:09:58.170\\nruss altman: So then comes my one of my favorite stories. I was giving a talk like this, but I didn&#x27;t have a great example of anybody actually using genetic information to re identify and then there was this great story and the, what is that UK\\n\\n56\\n00:09:59.280 --&gt; 00:10:12.180\\nruss altman: That London based, I want to say, The Daily Mail or the or the Guardian one of those had this great story about a teenager in the UK who figured out who his sperm donor father was\\n\\n57\\n00:10:13.080 --&gt; 00:10:29.730\\nruss altman: This team was my hero. So the father donate sperm anonymously 15 years ago he gets some money and they tell him that he will be forever anonymous. The only thing they&#x27;re ever going to give out. And this was their huge mistake was they were going to give out\\n\\n58\\n00:10:31.980 --&gt; 00:10:32.580\\nruss altman: Whoops.\\n\\n59\\n00:10:34.230 --&gt; 00:10:36.150\\nruss altman: The county where he was born.\\n\\n60\\n00:10:37.380 --&gt; 00:10:47.010\\nruss altman: And the year of his birth, and he said, Okay, you know that I come from a very populated County. And there was also many people born that year. Sounds Okay.\\n\\n61\\n00:10:47.520 --&gt; 00:10:57.450\\nruss altman: All right, so a woman gets a sperm donation has a baby baby grows up to be a teenager and is interested in his heritage and also and also smart.\\n\\n62\\n00:11:01.170 --&gt; 00:11:07.650\\nruss altman: There is a company that will use a commercial kid to look at your just your Y chromosome.\\n\\n63\\n00:11:09.150 --&gt; 00:11:19.560\\nruss altman: To tell you which version of the Y chromosome. You have now I will remind you that you get your Y chromosome from your biological father\\n\\n64\\n00:11:20.100 --&gt; 00:11:34.350\\nruss altman: And the kid knew this. So he said, Okay, I&#x27;m gonna find out about my Y chromosome that doesn&#x27;t tell you who your father is you know there&#x27;s 30 or 40 or 50 Y chromosome types, but obviously there&#x27;s a lot of people. However, this website.\\n\\n65\\n00:11:35.520 --&gt; 00:11:47.370\\nruss altman: This company had a website where if you gave up your last name, it would tell you other men who had the same pattern or variation in their Y chromosome. Now, you\\n\\n66\\n00:11:48.600 --&gt; 00:11:57.600\\nruss altman: The other thing you get from your dad in a petrol lineal society is their last name, which is which is what the UK is and was for the most part.\\n\\n67\\n00:11:58.320 --&gt; 00:12:07.170\\nruss altman: So this young man figured out that even if his biological father had not done this Y chromosome analysis.\\n\\n68\\n00:12:07.440 --&gt; 00:12:15.630\\nruss altman: There might be other people from that same family tree with the same Y chromosome, who would share the same last name.\\n\\n69\\n00:12:15.990 --&gt; 00:12:22.980\\nruss altman: So the kid got on the website gave his last name, which was irrelevant. It was whatever his mother&#x27;s or his adoptive father&#x27;s name was\\n\\n70\\n00:12:23.550 --&gt; 00:12:44.880\\nruss altman: But what he found out was all the names associated with that Y chromosome, and he could take the most common one and figure out, ah, this last name that that I&#x27;m seeing most commonly with this Y chromosome is probably my biological father&#x27;s last name. Oh, did we freeze.\\n\\n71\\n00:12:46.800 --&gt; 00:12:53.070\\nruss altman: I think we froze. So I&#x27;m going to stop here and restart because I don&#x27;t want to redo this part of the lecture.\\n\\n72\\n00:12:54.510 --&gt; 00:12:58.380\\nruss altman: But he figured out his last name.\\n\\n73\\n00:12:59.460 --&gt; 00:13:07.680\\nruss altman: Now he knew the county, the year M. The last name. He looked in the phone book he found two people with the same pattern.\\n\\n74\\n00:13:07.980 --&gt; 00:13:16.410\\nruss altman: He called one of them and said, Are you my father. And the guy said, I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about, and hung up, and he called the other one instead. Are you my father, and there was a long pause.\\n\\n75\\n00:13:16.920 --&gt; 00:13:24.510\\nruss altman: Bingo. You found your father, so he can find the he can find the information about age region of birth and year\\n\\n76\\n00:13:25.050 --&gt; 00:13:35.790\\nruss altman: To contact his father, so he really identified this guy who 15 YEARS AGO. GAVE sperm and thought he would never hear about it again, great example. And I&#x27;ll be back with the rest of the module.\\n\\n&quot;, &#x27;GMT20200407-010344_BioE-131-M.transcript.txt&#x27;: &quot;WEBVTT\\n\\n1\\n00:00:02.429 --&gt; 00:00:04.859\\nruss altman: Welcome to Module 11 hello, David.\\n\\n2\\n00:00:05.370 --&gt; 00:00:06.089\\nA Ross.\\n\\n3\\n00:00:07.500 --&gt; 00:00:08.099\\nDavid Magnus: Ready.\\n\\n4\\n00:00:08.610 --&gt; 00:00:13.290\\nDavid Magnus: Away. Today we&#x27;re gonna be talking about the uses of blood spots in research.\\n\\n5\\n00:00:15.120 --&gt; 00:00:27.300\\nDavid Magnus: So California law currently allows a theoretically parents to opt out, but almost none of them know that they can opt out of the uses for research. So in practice they don&#x27;t really have any option.\\n\\n6\\n00:00:28.350 --&gt; 00:00:38.460\\nDavid Magnus: There are people who make a lot of arguments, both in favor and against obtaining consent from people for allowing their uses and research and we&#x27;re going to just summarize some of those arguments.\\n\\n7\\n00:00:40.080 --&gt; 00:00:48.480\\nDavid Magnus: So first of all, there are some regulatory arguments against using a blood spots without consent first\\n\\n8\\n00:00:49.140 --&gt; 00:00:59.130\\nDavid Magnus: How is it even possible to use tissue from somebody without their consent. Well, the law allows the use of of material.\\n\\n9\\n00:00:59.790 --&gt; 00:01:08.580\\nDavid Magnus: As long as it&#x27;s de identified. So as long as the researchers don&#x27;t know who it&#x27;s from. Then under the current regulations that require that we get\\n\\n10\\n00:01:09.300 --&gt; 00:01:21.600\\nDavid Magnus: Informed consent for research, which we talked about earlier in the course, those regulations don&#x27;t apply because unless it&#x27;s identifiable. It doesn&#x27;t count as human subjects research.\\n\\n11\\n00:01:22.920 --&gt; 00:01:28.770\\nDavid Magnus: However, for this and this has really been the basis of why a lot of this blood spot. Research has taken place.\\n\\n12\\n00:01:29.010 --&gt; 00:01:37.890\\nDavid Magnus: However, and we&#x27;re going to be talking about this issue of re identification in much more detail in a future class, but the idea that you could have data.\\n\\n13\\n00:01:38.220 --&gt; 00:01:53.130\\nDavid Magnus: And especially genomic data and claim that it&#x27;s the identified has become increasingly problematic. And what that means is that the loophole in a way that people have been using to justify research without consent.\\n\\n14\\n00:01:54.630 --&gt; 00:01:56.730\\nDavid Magnus: Is getting harder and harder to maintain\\n\\n15\\n00:01:57.810 --&gt; 00:01:59.970\\nDavid Magnus: And some of the new regulations governing\\n\\n16\\n00:02:01.080 --&gt; 00:02:09.720\\nDavid Magnus: Research with blood spots explicitly says we should think of these things as identifiable therefore that loophole goes away.\\n\\n17\\n00:02:10.620 --&gt; 00:02:19.140\\nDavid Magnus: In addition to this regulatory argument. There&#x27;s also an ethical argument against using samples for research without consent.\\n\\n18\\n00:02:20.130 --&gt; 00:02:34.650\\nDavid Magnus: A lot of bioethicists have have done studies and surveys and they show that most of the public wants to be asked for permission before their samples are used. In fact, the people behind the campaigns in Minnesota.\\n\\n19\\n00:02:34.980 --&gt; 00:02:40.890\\nDavid Magnus: And in Texas that led to the destruction of their blood spots what the leaders all said was\\n\\n20\\n00:02:41.160 --&gt; 00:02:53.520\\nDavid Magnus: I would have consented, and let you use my blood spots, but doing it without buying permission is just wrong, and therefore I we bought these blood spot should be thrown out and you shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to do this unless you ask for permission first.\\n\\n21\\n00:02:55.860 --&gt; 00:02:58.650\\nDavid Magnus: privacy rights regarding control of this information.\\n\\n22\\n00:02:59.670 --&gt; 00:03:05.220\\nDavid Magnus: suggests a violation. So that&#x27;s the ontological concern that this is a violation of them as individuals.\\n\\n23\\n00:03:05.610 --&gt; 00:03:20.730\\nDavid Magnus: Moreover, it&#x27;s really important that the public have trust in the research community and we know that consent can play an important role in that process, a group of researchers led by Jeff Bob can have done a study of\\n\\n24\\n00:03:22.080 --&gt; 00:03:30.270\\nDavid Magnus: Of thinking about how what the best approach to this is when they looked at all the empirical studies of public attitudes parental attitudes.\\n\\n25\\n00:03:30.510 --&gt; 00:03:36.720\\nDavid Magnus: When they look at all the guideline statements from professional bodies as well as actual state policies.\\n\\n26\\n00:03:37.320 --&gt; 00:03:48.810\\nDavid Magnus: They use that as a basis for an expert working group and the result was that they made some recommendations, though most people when you ask them prefer opt in consent, where you actually say Can I have permission.\\n\\n27\\n00:03:49.590 --&gt; 00:03:57.030\\nDavid Magnus: The group concluded that opt out consent was justifiable, that is, you would still ask for permission but the default\\n\\n28\\n00:03:57.930 --&gt; 00:04:09.000\\nDavid Magnus: Would be that they would that they were presumed to be in the research, unless they explicitly said, I don&#x27;t want to be a part of it. And this creates a little bit of a nudge using trace art, architecture in favor of it.\\n\\n29\\n00:04:09.540 --&gt; 00:04:15.060\\nruss altman: Just compose there. I believe there&#x27;s a ton of data that you get very different\\n\\n30\\n00:04:15.750 --&gt; 00:04:26.940\\nruss altman: numbers of people signing up in opt in versus opt out. So even though, in theory, saying opt in or opt out should lead to the same number, depending if you&#x27;re making your decisions solely on your preferences.\\n\\n31\\n00:04:27.480 --&gt; 00:04:36.360\\nruss altman: There&#x27;s a literature that shows that when you opt in, you get if it&#x27;s automatic opt in, you get way less people than if you automatically opt them out.\\n\\n32\\n00:04:36.870 --&gt; 00:04:46.980\\nDavid Magnus: That&#x27;s correct. That&#x27;s really why choice architecture and and preset preferences really work to have a different have an impact on on on people&#x27;s behavior.\\n\\n33\\n00:04:48.120 --&gt; 00:04:55.350\\nDavid Magnus: But, of course, the more robust that the opt out consent is, the more it gets like opt in.\\n\\n34\\n00:04:55.620 --&gt; 00:04:57.360\\nDavid Magnus: Then the less that impact has\\n\\n35\\n00:04:58.860 --&gt; 00:05:02.760\\nDavid Magnus: So, and, and one of the things that some of the researchers found is\\n\\n36\\n00:05:03.000 --&gt; 00:05:10.170\\nDavid Magnus: People who said, I think I should opt in. When explained why they didn&#x27;t think that was a good idea because you wouldn&#x27;t have robust enough numbers.\\n\\n37\\n00:05:10.380 --&gt; 00:05:23.340\\nDavid Magnus: The data wouldn&#x27;t be as useful. And what if we did a really robust opt out. Most people come around to saying opt out would be okay. And so that&#x27;s more or less the majority view in the bioethics community.\\n\\n38\\n00:05:23.820 --&gt; 00:05:30.060\\nDavid Magnus: But there are some important arguments in favor of using even unscented blood spots and maybe not requiring consent.\\n\\n39\\n00:05:31.410 --&gt; 00:05:39.240\\nDavid Magnus: Obviously, currently, it doesn&#x27;t count as human subjects under the regulations. If it&#x27;s the identified, but we&#x27;ve already seen that that may be problematic.\\n\\n40\\n00:05:40.380 --&gt; 00:05:49.830\\nDavid Magnus: But what some other arguments in favor include the fact that to some extent there, whether you consent or not. There has to be some research like activities.\\n\\n41\\n00:05:50.160 --&gt; 00:05:57.540\\nDavid Magnus: With blood spots, whether there&#x27;s consent or not. And that&#x27;s because even be to be able to order to use them for clinical purposes.\\n\\n42\\n00:05:57.810 --&gt; 00:06:06.570\\nDavid Magnus: You have to have quality assurance and quality improvement activities that take place on a regular basis to make sure that the test really work the way you think they do.\\n\\n43\\n00:06:06.870 --&gt; 00:06:17.820\\nDavid Magnus: And you, there is no way of opting out of that. So a very research like activity has to take place anyway, even without research and that QA QA work is\\n\\n44\\n00:06:18.510 --&gt; 00:06:28.110\\nDavid Magnus: Is outside of the regulatory system and so is allowed to be done. Moreover, the one of the worries that a lot of people have about creating even an opt out.\\n\\n45\\n00:06:28.830 --&gt; 00:06:41.760\\nDavid Magnus: consent process is that you will have less people in the databases and that that will lead to both less data less robust data and, especially, there&#x27;s a concern that that data may become\\n\\n46\\n00:06:42.180 --&gt; 00:06:53.610\\nDavid Magnus: wider and more educated and more middle class, middle class to athletes, because in general when you require consent even opt out consent, you wind up getting\\n\\n47\\n00:06:54.060 --&gt; 00:07:05.340\\nDavid Magnus: More people who are white signing up for research and you end up having less ethnic and racial minorities in groups that are underrepresented in research traditionally be included.\\n\\n48\\n00:07:06.630 --&gt; 00:07:08.700\\nDavid Magnus: Our colleague Carlos Bustamante\\n\\n49\\n00:07:09.780 --&gt; 00:07:11.130\\nDavid Magnus: This was must have been about\\n\\n50\\n00:07:12.210 --&gt; 00:07:21.780\\nDavid Magnus: Something like around eight or 10 years ago looked at genome wide association studies and at that time they were almost all done on people of European descent.\\n\\n51\\n00:07:22.110 --&gt; 00:07:28.020\\nDavid Magnus: A few years later, it got a little bit better in the US, but it was still about 96% or 94%\\n\\n52\\n00:07:28.890 --&gt; 00:07:37.230\\nDavid Magnus: From people of European descent in the research in the US and up until I would say, up until now there&#x27;s efforts to try to improve that with things like the\\n\\n53\\n00:07:37.530 --&gt; 00:07:53.940\\nDavid Magnus: All of us research program, but the truth is that most research repositories remain mostly middle class educated white people, which we know already know a lot about. And when you increase the consent requirements you make the the data more biased.\\n\\n54\\n00:07:54.330 --&gt; 00:08:00.480\\nruss altman: And saying if those underrepresented groups don&#x27;t trust the Healthcare Research Establishment\\n\\n55\\n00:08:01.620 --&gt; 00:08:06.090\\nruss altman: Is it really the right thing to do, to say, well, we&#x27;re going to take that choice away from you.\\n\\n56\\n00:08:06.390 --&gt; 00:08:10.500\\nDavid Magnus: So that&#x27;s a really great question. And that really relates to the question of really\\n\\n57\\n00:08:11.100 --&gt; 00:08:16.920\\nDavid Magnus: What establishes trust. And so the people who want to defend the unconsidered blood spots.\\n\\n58\\n00:08:17.220 --&gt; 00:08:26.460\\nDavid Magnus: Are skeptical that informed consent forms and a few lines and informed consent form that people barely read and sign or refuse to sign\\n\\n59\\n00:08:26.760 --&gt; 00:08:36.720\\nDavid Magnus: Really is a very powerful way of demonstrating respect for the research participants and that will we need to do is keep these people included in the research.\\n\\n60\\n00:08:36.960 --&gt; 00:08:50.160\\nDavid Magnus: Because unconsidered blood spots are the most diverse databases that we have for lunch genomic point of view, but to actually find other more meaningful ways of demonstrating respect for those populations.\\n\\n61\\n00:08:50.790 --&gt; 00:09:00.990\\nDavid Magnus: Rather than relying on a few lot you know a few maybe even just a few paragraphs of an informed consent form that&#x27;s probably not understand unless they&#x27;re their lawyers.\\n\\n62\\n00:09:01.920 --&gt; 00:09:08.970\\nDavid Magnus: There&#x27;s no evidence that anybody has ever been harmed. As a result of a stored sample for decades. So the risk is low.\\n\\n63\\n00:09:09.420 --&gt; 00:09:15.870\\nDavid Magnus: And another thing that&#x27;s really important is that there&#x27;s evidence that people do value the research.\\n\\n64\\n00:09:16.380 --&gt; 00:09:22.020\\nDavid Magnus: That&#x27;s being done. So on the one hand, we want to respect the fact that people are saying, I want to give consent.\\n\\n65\\n00:09:22.350 --&gt; 00:09:30.000\\nDavid Magnus: But people are also saying when you give those people surveys. I want there to be a robust database of research and for this research to take place.\\n\\n66\\n00:09:30.240 --&gt; 00:09:38.820\\nDavid Magnus: The same surveys show that very clearly and what&#x27;s happened is that the bioethics community has basically said we&#x27;re going to give priority to one preference over another.\\n\\n67\\n00:09:39.120 --&gt; 00:09:46.860\\nDavid Magnus: But people don&#x27;t really ask that question, so they don&#x27;t ask the people like well you want the research to take place and you also want to give consent.\\n\\n68\\n00:09:47.070 --&gt; 00:09:53.490\\nDavid Magnus: But those two things may be incompatible, to some extent, and if they don&#x27;t fit together. Which do you think is more important.\\n\\n69\\n00:09:53.760 --&gt; 00:10:01.620\\nDavid Magnus: That turns out to be very hard to study, it&#x27;s not been studied very much but we&#x27;ve gotten some surprising answers when we&#x27;ve tried to explore some of those issues.\\n\\n70\\n00:10:01.860 --&gt; 00:10:12.510\\nDavid Magnus: In a study that we did, we found that 70% of people said they&#x27;d be willing to forgo consent or or lower the consent requirements in order for research to be possible.\\n\\n71\\n00:10:12.780 --&gt; 00:10:17.790\\nruss altman: Let me just say that my pen just ran out of ink. So we&#x27;re on our own from here on out. But keep going.\\n\\n72\\n00:10:18.060 --&gt; 00:10:33.720\\nDavid Magnus: Okay, so I&#x27;ll just say that one of the other challenges is when you ask people for consent. If it&#x27;s very specific consent about each particular research project that really becomes impossible and would make the research databases useless.\\n\\n73\\n00:10:34.740 --&gt; 00:10:35.670\\nDavid Magnus: There you go. Got it back.\\n\\n74\\n00:10:36.390 --&gt; 00:10:38.220\\nruss altman: I unplugged it and plugged it back in.\\n\\n75\\n00:10:38.520 --&gt; 00:10:49.740\\nDavid Magnus: Okay, there we go. So, so, so, so, so specific consent really would make the research unusable because you couldn&#x27;t ask. Go, go back to\\n\\n76\\n00:10:50.040 --&gt; 00:10:56.550\\nDavid Magnus: The database. Go back to, to all the blood spots and try and track everybody down for every time a researcher wanted to use this\\n\\n77\\n00:10:56.790 --&gt; 00:11:05.400\\nDavid Magnus: Which would mean that if you were going to have consent at all. It would have to be a very broad consent, which, again, if you&#x27;re thinking about this as a way of demonstrating respect telling them.\\n\\n78\\n00:11:05.760 --&gt; 00:11:13.350\\nDavid Magnus: We&#x27;re going to do use your blood spots for research. We don&#x27;t know exactly what&#x27;s going to be done with them, they&#x27;ll be some kind of genomic or genetic analysis done\\n\\n79\\n00:11:13.620 --&gt; 00:11:21.360\\nDavid Magnus: We can&#x27;t really predict what it&#x27;s going to be, it doesn&#x27;t really tell you very much. If you have broad consent and and yet.\\n\\n80\\n00:11:22.560 --&gt; 00:11:32.880\\nDavid Magnus: If you don&#x27;t, if you try to, as I said, have specific consent for every research project, then it would actually make the research absolutely impossible to take place.\\n\\n81\\n00:11:33.810 --&gt; 00:11:40.050\\nDavid Magnus: So cheer, there&#x27;s a trade off. People want to give consent. They want the research to take place and they want to reap its benefits.\\n\\n82\\n00:11:40.830 --&gt; 00:11:48.450\\nDavid Magnus: So studying this issue is really something that we need to do more of to see what people think of, but we also need to be\\n\\n83\\n00:11:49.080 --&gt; 00:11:57.990\\nDavid Magnus: Aware of what our options are for trying to have data that&#x27;s truly diverse and useful for researchers\\n\\n84\\n00:11:58.560 --&gt; 00:12:04.770\\nDavid Magnus: While also being respectful to participants. There&#x27;s one last wrinkle. I just want to mention, and that is\\n\\n85\\n00:12:05.550 --&gt; 00:12:17.400\\nDavid Magnus: So far we&#x27;ve been talking about this in the US context, but at least some other countries, and there&#x27;s always the potential in this country as well that there could be negative associations with some of this. So for example, in China.\\n\\n86\\n00:12:17.910 --&gt; 00:12:26.610\\nDavid Magnus: Police collected biometric information and samples of 19 million people who were being a press who are Muslims\\n\\n87\\n00:12:27.570 --&gt; 00:12:30.480\\nDavid Magnus: And using some of these technologies to try and figure out\\n\\n88\\n00:12:31.170 --&gt; 00:12:38.670\\nDavid Magnus: Who, who, people were from their DNA and to try and figure out facial patterns that they would expect to see what people would look like from their DNA.\\n\\n89\\n00:12:38.940 --&gt; 00:12:53.250\\nDavid Magnus: So they could identify them from seeing them in crowds and things like that. So there&#x27;s definitely the potential that this technology could be abused by the state or by other commercial entities and so we need to be aware of the fact that that that\\n\\n90\\n00:12:54.300 --&gt; 00:13:12.630\\nDavid Magnus: Doing this in a respectful manner requires that the uses of it be protected and some of the mechanisms for doing that include things like having really important and good governance and oversight of this research so that these kinds of uses. Don&#x27;t take place.\\n\\n91\\n00:13:14.100 --&gt; 00:13:15.000\\nDavid Magnus: And that&#x27;s it.\\n\\n92\\n00:13:15.870 --&gt; 00:13:23.160\\nruss altman: That was it. Thank you very much, the issues related to using blood spots for research. Sorry about the little pen.\\n\\n93\\n00:13:24.300 --&gt; 00:13:29.010\\nruss altman: Issue, but we will stop the share and we will stop the meeting. Thanks.\\n\\n&quot;}\n",

This is the second part of module 22 which froze in my PowerPoint. So you just heard the story about the team who found his father in the UK and US became my hero as a early case of DNA re identification.\\n\\n2\\n00:00:21.390 --&gt; 00:00:37.980\\nruss altman: The next thing I want to tell you about, which is worrisome is this idea of identifying individuals for in a mixture. It had been widely assumed that if you have like 1000 people&#x27;s DNA in a mixture and this was somebody studied this because of forensics. Let&#x27;s say you have a\\n\\n3\\n00:00:39.180 --&gt; 00:00:43.140\\nruss altman: Person who&#x27;s not allowed to go to children&#x27;s parks, because they were a sex offender.\\n\\n4\\n00:00:44.490 --&gt; 00:00:56.880\\nruss altman: And you collected DNA at the park. There&#x27;s no way you would be able to figure out if that person was one of the people who had been at that park and left some of their DNA that was an assumption which turned out to be wrong, and in\\n\\n5\\n00:00:58.350 --&gt; 00:01:05.820\\nruss altman: Homer at all published a paper showing that if you have the genome, the genetics of a single individual.\\n\\n6\\n00:01:06.810 --&gt; 00:01:19.320\\nruss altman: And they don&#x27;t even need the whole genome. They just need about a million snips and you can measure a million snips for like 200 bucks 23andMe does a million snips as part of their $99 genetic\\n\\n7\\n00:01:20.430 --&gt; 00:01:36.090\\nruss altman: rundown. So if you can have a million snips for a single individual. And then you have a mixture of 1000 individuals and you want to know is my individual part of that mixture, you can determine that with extremely high confidence.\\n\\n8\\n00:01:37.140 --&gt; 00:01:41.610\\nruss altman: That was a surprise to people. And I just want to give you a sense for how where it comes from.\\n\\n9\\n00:01:44.190 --&gt; 00:01:55.260\\nruss altman: Okay I froze again and that irritates me so I&#x27;m just going to stop the share and restart the share hoping that that solves this problem apologize for this.\\n\\n10\\n00:02:01.260 --&gt; 00:02:03.750\\nruss altman: All right, let&#x27;s see if we can go to the next slide.\\n\\n11\\n00:02:13.050 --&gt; 00:02:18.510\\nruss altman: I do not want to draw that much I mostly want to get in back into my lecture, please.\\n\\n12\\n00:02:23.250 --&gt; 00:02:26.040\\nruss altman: So bush league Ross.\\n\\n13\\n00:02:27.120 --&gt; 00:02:37.830\\nruss altman: How did they do it statistics. So they have a million measurements of the invalid individual, for example, there&#x27;s an A deposition 3432\\n\\n14\\n00:02:39.570 --&gt; 00:02:45.030\\nruss altman: So let&#x27;s assume that 10% of all people in the general population have an A and 90% of a tea.\\n\\n15\\n00:02:45.750 --&gt; 00:03:09.810\\nruss altman: Now you have a million measurements of a mixture of 1000 other people have a mixture of 1000 people from that population. Okay, so let&#x27;s say that in those thousand people. There&#x27;s a 15% rate of a, an attempt at 5% rate of tea at that same position. Now our person had an A at at that position.\\n\\n16\\n00:03:11.250 --&gt; 00:03:14.340\\nruss altman: And you&#x27;re seeing slightly more A&#x27;s.\\n\\n17\\n00:03:15.690 --&gt; 00:03:20.310\\nruss altman: In the mixture than you are in the population at large.\\n\\n18\\n00:03:21.360 --&gt; 00:03:22.320\\nruss altman: Versus 10\\n\\n19\\n00:03:23.370 --&gt; 00:03:34.590\\nruss altman: So this person could have contributed that slight bit of extra a to the mixture does approve anything. Absolutely not.\\n\\n20\\n00:03:34.980 --&gt; 00:03:47.040\\nruss altman: First of all, they could not be in the mixture. Second of all, they could not be contributing to the X ray, but it increases the chance that they were in the mixture a tiny, tiny, tiny bit.\\n\\n21\\n00:03:48.270 --&gt; 00:03:54.870\\nruss altman: Now, so it&#x27;s slightly more probable that that individual is in, then they&#x27;re out\\n\\n22\\n00:03:56.340 --&gt; 00:04:03.600\\nruss altman: Now this is where your intuition loses you though because we have a million such measurements.\\n\\n23\\n00:04:04.020 --&gt; 00:04:15.030\\nruss altman: So every one of these tiny things that&#x27;s either in favor or against the hypothesis that they&#x27;re in the mixture adds up. And it turns out that somewhere around\\n\\n24\\n00:04:15.900 --&gt; 00:04:27.330\\nruss altman: 200 300,000 of these measurements you are positive that that person is either in or out. And then the other 700,000 just serve to increase your certainty.\\n\\n25\\n00:04:28.770 --&gt; 00:04:40.770\\nruss altman: So that&#x27;s a that&#x27;s amazing and true and it showed that people&#x27;s intuitions about went about when DNA is safe in a mixture were wrong.\\n\\n26\\n00:04:41.190 --&gt; 00:04:44.430\\nruss altman: This cause shock waves throughout the National Institutes of Health.\\n\\n27\\n00:04:44.700 --&gt; 00:04:58.080\\nruss altman: Because they had databases, where they said, here is the summary data for 1000 people, they would say 15% 85% t and they thought they were fine. And they didn&#x27;t have to worry about anybody in that study being identified\\n\\n28\\n00:04:58.410 --&gt; 00:05:06.870\\nruss altman: But if you had the genome of one of those 1000 people you could run it through the NIH database. And you could figure out if that person.\\n\\n29\\n00:05:07.230 --&gt; 00:05:09.000\\nruss altman: Participated in a study or not.\\n\\n30\\n00:05:09.390 --&gt; 00:05:21.420\\nruss altman: Why would we care about this. Well, let&#x27;s say the person signed up for a study with a sensitive diagnosis. They were sensitive about the disease that they had, they didn&#x27;t really want the rest of the world to know or their ensures or their employers.\\n\\n31\\n00:05:21.660 --&gt; 00:05:27.930\\nruss altman: And now there&#x27;s a way for somebody to figure out if they&#x27;re part of that mixture and therefore if they might have that disease.\\n\\n32\\n00:05:30.030 --&gt; 00:05:41.940\\nruss altman: This became clear and there was a New York Times article in 2013 where they showed that people could use genetics, plus the state and their age to re identify people\\n\\n33\\n00:05:42.930 --&gt; 00:05:47.700\\nruss altman: And these kinds of articles now are routinely appearing in the New York Times, showing that\\n\\n34\\n00:05:48.180 --&gt; 00:06:10.800\\nruss altman: People&#x27;s assumptions about their privacy with respect to their DNA are in many cases wrong and we really as a society need to discuss what should be the rules. So I just want to leave you with this. I should have mentioned this before I want to tell you about a law. It&#x27;s called the genetic\\n\\n35\\n00:06:13.170 --&gt; 00:06:14.370\\nruss altman: Information\\n\\n36\\n00:06:17.760 --&gt; 00:06:21.780\\nruss altman: Non discrimination act on this.\\n\\n37\\n00:06:23.130 --&gt; 00:06:24.780\\nruss altman: Whoa, let&#x27;s, let&#x27;s, a\\n\\n38\\n00:06:28.170 --&gt; 00:06:31.050\\nruss altman: Non discrimination.\\n\\n39\\n00:06:32.490 --&gt; 00:06:34.320\\nruss altman: Act or Gina\\n\\n40\\n00:06:36.750 --&gt; 00:06:44.250\\nruss altman: Gina was passed to say that you cannot discriminate against people based on their genetic data because the genetic data.\\n\\n41\\n00:06:44.610 --&gt; 00:06:57.240\\nruss altman: Often is manipulating probabilities, but it&#x27;s not giving anything that&#x27;s definite, even if it is definite though it&#x27;s not clear that you should hold it against people in employment or other forms of\\n\\n42\\n00:06:59.190 --&gt; 00:07:07.950\\nruss altman: Of financial transactions Gina is a pretty good act, but it&#x27;s limited because it does not cover disability insurance.\\n\\n43\\n00:07:11.070 --&gt; 00:07:21.750\\nruss altman: And it does not cover life insurance so they can still they being the insurance companies can still discriminate you when they&#x27;re making decisions about life insurance or disability insurance.\\n\\n44\\n00:07:22.110 --&gt; 00:07:26.040\\nruss altman: But they can&#x27;t use it for health insurance. And so that&#x27;s a big one.\\n\\n45\\n00:07:26.730 --&gt; 00:07:32.790\\nruss altman: Because now pre existing genetic information can be used to raise your rates or deny health insurance.\\n\\n46\\n00:07:33.120 --&gt; 00:07:49.980\\nruss altman: So, Gina is imperfect, but it&#x27;s a step in the right direction. Many people think most people believe that we should get rid of these exceptions and maybe we&#x27;ll talk about it in class. Okay, that&#x27;s the end of this second half of module 22\\n\\n&quot;, &#x27;GMT20200420-171758_BioE-131-M.transcript.txt&#x27;: &quot;WEBVTT\\n\\n1\\n00:00:03.179 --&gt; 00:00:08.400\\nruss altman: A bio 131. This is Russ in module 22\\n\\n2\\n00:00:09.719 --&gt; 00:00:22.200\\nruss altman: Now this is not a tech briefing module, but this is Russ, so you&#x27;re not going to get the kind of deep ethical analysis that David usually gives but hopefully we will get you close to ethics.\\n\\n3\\n00:00:22.980 --&gt; 00:00:35.760\\nruss altman: So that we can have a good discussion in class. And so you can think about these things. So this is not being labeled a technical briefing module, but you&#x27;ll see that it has more of the flavor of technical stuff and less of the ethics stuff. So whatever\\n\\n4\\n00:00:36.420 --&gt; 00:00:42.000\\nruss altman: And I hope you&#x27;re all having a good hair day you know hair is becoming an issue for all of us without any haircuts being available and so\\n\\n5\\n00:00:42.900 --&gt; 00:00:56.490\\nruss altman: A re identify ability. This is the idea that people create databases that they think are secure and which cannot have any of the individual participants be re identify\\n\\n6\\n00:00:57.360 --&gt; 00:01:07.080\\nruss altman: And cannot have any of the participants identified, but it&#x27;s false, because bottom line for this module is that\\n\\n7\\n00:01:07.620 --&gt; 00:01:16.530\\nruss altman: Sets of databases can be combined to figure out who is in a database, even if an individual database seems to be secure.\\n\\n8\\n00:01:17.490 --&gt; 00:01:23.790\\nruss altman: So in the technical briefing module. I talked about pharmacogenomics. And this database farm GK be that we&#x27;re building and we got worried\\n\\n9\\n00:01:24.120 --&gt; 00:01:34.230\\nruss altman: Because we were a genetic database. We were supporting research and we had DNA from subjects and we also had phenotype data. Most of the phenotype data was how they responded to drugs.\\n\\n10\\n00:01:35.070 --&gt; 00:01:42.120\\nruss altman: As I said in the last module is about 10 million locations in the genome. And one of the calculations we did and we published this\\n\\n11\\n00:01:42.780 --&gt; 00:01:52.230\\nruss altman: Was that even though there are 10 million locations you only need 60 to 100 of these snips. Remember the snips, the single base pair switches\\n\\n12\\n00:01:52.680 --&gt; 00:02:03.480\\nruss altman: If you tell me 100 positions in your genome and which letter you have that&#x27;s enough typically for you to be unique, other than a\\n\\n13\\n00:02:04.470 --&gt; 00:02:16.380\\nruss altman: Other than a a identical twin. So that was a wake up call for everybody because it was like, wow, you don&#x27;t need a very big piece of DNA to make it like a fingerprint now.\\n\\n14\\n00:02:16.830 --&gt; 00:02:26.520\\nruss altman: The thing is just because you have the DNA and you sequence it and you know those hundred measurements that doesn&#x27;t tell you who the person is unless there&#x27;s another database.\\n\\n15\\n00:02:26.880 --&gt; 00:02:33.630\\nruss altman: That has either the person&#x27;s identification and their DNA. So you could match up the DNA and figure out who the person is\\n\\n16\\n00:02:34.140 --&gt; 00:02:43.860\\nruss altman: Or if it has enough information about that person without giving you their actual name. There&#x27;s enough information for you to figure out their name like\\n\\n17\\n00:02:44.460 --&gt; 00:02:57.630\\nruss altman: All of their geo locations over the last period of time or all of their purchases on Amazon. Again, not as easy as looking up a name. But if you are motivated and if you have a lot of data, you may be able to figure out who they are.\\n\\n18\\n00:02:57.960 --&gt; 00:03:01.890\\nruss altman: And this is what this is about, particularly in the context of genetic data.\\n\\n19\\n00:03:02.700 --&gt; 00:03:13.710\\nruss altman: So as I said, if the genetic data can be associated with the phenotype data, then you might be able to figure out who&#x27;s in a study and I&#x27;ll give you some examples. So we can make it real.\\n\\n20\\n00:03:14.190 --&gt; 00:03:28.620\\nruss altman: In fact, there are examples before DNA was a thing or before it was, you know, measured routinely. There&#x27;s a couple of great cases. My favorite case is the governor of Massachusetts. Well, this was about 20 years ago.\\n\\n21\\n00:03:29.850 --&gt; 00:03:42.480\\nruss altman: He released public health records. And he said, This is great. He said, We&#x27;re going to catalyze research and public health. We&#x27;ve removed all the names and birthdays and addresses.\\n\\n22\\n00:03:43.350 --&gt; 00:03:46.500\\nruss altman: Detailed addresses so you don&#x27;t have to worry about your privacy.\\n\\n23\\n00:03:47.490 --&gt; 00:03:55.680\\nruss altman: And of course, Massachusetts is the home for Harvard Medical School and many other medical schools, and this was going to be a great thing for Massachusetts to have this great data set.\\n\\n24\\n00:03:56.100 --&gt; 00:04:08.820\\nruss altman: Well, three days after governor weld released this data, a researcher at MIT, who was a privacy expert sent governor weld medical records to the Boston Globe.\\n\\n25\\n00:04:09.840 --&gt; 00:04:11.760\\nruss altman: In a beautiful, beautiful moment.\\n\\n26\\n00:04:12.930 --&gt; 00:04:23.940\\nruss altman: And so what did they do well. It was true that the names and addresses had been removed, but they showed that they could use the voter ID roles which are public.\\n\\n27\\n00:04:24.270 --&gt; 00:04:27.090\\nruss altman: And the Department of Motor Vehicle roles which are public.\\n\\n28\\n00:04:27.390 --&gt; 00:04:40.830\\nruss altman: To figure out governor welds age his birthday, where he lives and then the one other thing they had was, they actually the Boston Globe itself had published at peace, saying that the governor had been to the doctor on a certain day\\n\\n29\\n00:04:41.070 --&gt; 00:04:57.450\\nruss altman: And had a clean bill of health. It was like a little public interest piece, but then they knew at least one day when somebody of Governor weld age and in his neighborhood went to a physician that generated a bill and with all of that and the bill was in the public health data.\\n\\n30\\n00:04:58.830 --&gt; 00:05:07.560\\nruss altman: So those data sets, they were able to combine and figure out that that was the governor. Now, could they do this for everybody. Well,\\n\\n31\\n00:05:07.800 --&gt; 00:05:25.980\\nruss altman: Not routinely because we all don&#x27;t have our visits to the doctor put into the Boston Globe, but we all do certain things on Facebook or whatever that might give somebody a clue that would allow them to re identify a data set that otherwise seemed like it might be private and de identified\\n\\n32\\n00:05:27.690 --&gt; 00:05:39.720\\nruss altman: The same researcher went on to show that there&#x27;s a problem in the medical literature with rare diseases. So they, in this case, they went to the New England Journal of Medicine, you know, one of the fanciest medical research journals.\\n\\n33\\n00:05:40.740 --&gt; 00:05:52.320\\nruss altman: And they had like the University of Chicago. I believe had done a study on a rare disease and they had included DNA sequence in in the article.\\n\\n34\\n00:05:53.490 --&gt; 00:06:06.810\\nruss altman: And it was long enough so that it had lots of these snips. Now, my colleague by the way this is Tanya Sweeney, who now. I think I don&#x27;t know where she is now. She had, she had been at MIT. She went to\\n\\n35\\n00:06:08.940 --&gt; 00:06:14.220\\nruss altman: She went to Penn and I think she might be at Harvard. I&#x27;m confused about where she is. But she&#x27;s great.\\n\\n36\\n00:06:15.810 --&gt; 00:06:24.870\\nruss altman: She figured that well let&#x27;s just look at the Chicago area probably people who go to the University of Chicago. Medical Center are in the Chicago area.\\n\\n37\\n00:06:25.080 --&gt; 00:06:33.240\\nruss altman: So, and this is a rare disease. So when she went to the public health records. There was not hundreds and hundreds of people with these diseases, there was like four\\n\\n38\\n00:06:33.630 --&gt; 00:06:45.210\\nruss altman: And then they sit the in the in the New England Journal article the the investigators had also said, oh, and this is a five year old little girl when I, you know, five year old little girl rare diagnosis.\\n\\n39\\n00:06:46.140 --&gt; 00:06:53.430\\nruss altman: Now you know some of that girls little DNA sequence know her DNA was perfectly normal size of the little girl was little.\\n\\n40\\n00:06:54.090 --&gt; 00:07:03.330\\nruss altman: But, you know, now who that patient probably was. Now, of course, my colleague didn&#x27;t do anything nefarious with its information, but she did publish\\n\\n41\\n00:07:03.720 --&gt; 00:07:13.530\\nruss altman: On the fact that there are these risks that people are taking that they might not fully realize when they provide data in such a way that it could be\\n\\n42\\n00:07:14.460 --&gt; 00:07:24.900\\nruss altman: Used to re identify subjects we always ask or we like to think that we always ask patients if we can use their data for research and we&#x27;re very grateful when they consent.\\n\\n43\\n00:07:25.830 --&gt; 00:07:38.940\\nruss altman: But part of that consent is usually a some sort of guarantee that their identity will be kept private and now there&#x27;s a real question about whether you should make a guarantee.\\n\\n44\\n00:07:39.660 --&gt; 00:07:49.920\\nruss altman: Versus just say we&#x27;re going to make best effort to keep your identity private. But these kinds of things can happen. And we would be lying if we said that we can absolutely guaranteed privacy.\\n\\n45\\n00:07:52.170 --&gt; 00:07:56.490\\nruss altman: So we wrote a paper about this, as I said, this is now super old 16 years old.\\n\\n46\\n00:07:58.380 --&gt; 00:08:06.810\\nruss altman: ardo and isn&#x27;t statistics here Jen was a graduate student and we talked about this trade off between genomic research and human subject privacy.\\n\\n47\\n00:08:07.350 --&gt; 00:08:18.960\\nruss altman: So this is the paper where we did the calculation that 60 to 100 snips are basically unique any 60 to 100 snips are basically unique for a person\\n\\n48\\n00:08:19.650 --&gt; 00:08:33.660\\nruss altman: And then we wrote it up as a Policy Forum, because although they liked our scientific finding they thought the more important message might be about what does this mean for a policy about genetic genetic privacy.\\n\\n49\\n00:08:35.190 --&gt; 00:08:47.280\\nruss altman: So here is the EU, I have to delete some of that some of that writing here is the main graph which we came up with it is extremely simple but they liked it.\\n\\n50\\n00:08:48.450 --&gt; 00:08:53.550\\nruss altman: On the x axis. It&#x27;s the number of snips that are measured\\n\\n51\\n00:08:54.960 --&gt; 00:09:02.700\\nruss altman: And on the y axis is a, I would say a qualitative metric of privacy being low, medium, and high\\n\\n52\\n00:09:03.420 --&gt; 00:09:15.150\\nruss altman: Not my most quantitative moment of my career, but what we showed is if you want high privacy. You can only release tiny, tiny amounts of your DNA for any kind of guarantee\\n\\n53\\n00:09:15.600 --&gt; 00:09:21.600\\nruss altman: And as soon as you get up to 100 snips or beyond your privacy is low.\\n\\n54\\n00:09:22.080 --&gt; 00:09:39.030\\nruss altman: But that is precisely where we are going to make discoveries. So we really want to be out here to the far right, which means we have a problem with our guarantees of privacy, which we really should not make and that was the main point of that article.\\n\\n55\\n00:09:43.650 --&gt; 00:09:58.170\\nruss altman: So then comes my one of my favorite stories. I was giving a talk like this, but I didn&#x27;t have a great example of anybody actually using genetic information to re identify and then there was this great story and the, what is that UK\\n\\n56\\n00:09:59.280 --&gt; 00:10:12.180\\nruss altman: That London based, I want to say, The Daily Mail or the or the Guardian one of those had this great story about a teenager in the UK who figured out who his sperm donor father was\\n\\n57\\n00:10:13.080 --&gt; 00:10:29.730\\nruss altman: This team was my hero. So the father donate sperm anonymously 15 years ago he gets some money and they tell him that he will be forever anonymous. The only thing they&#x27;re ever going to give out. And this was their huge mistake was they were going to give out\\n\\n58\\n00:10:31.980 --&gt; 00:10:32.580\\nruss altman: Whoops.\\n\\n59\\n00:10:34.230 --&gt; 00:10:36.150\\nruss altman: The county where he was born.\\n\\n60\\n00:10:37.380 --&gt; 00:10:47.010\\nruss altman: And the year of his birth, and he said, Okay, you know that I come from a very populated County. And there was also many people born that year. Sounds Okay.\\n\\n61\\n00:10:47.520 --&gt; 00:10:57.450\\nruss altman: All right, so a woman gets a sperm donation has a baby baby grows up to be a teenager and is interested in his heritage and also and also smart.\\n\\n62\\n00:11:01.170 --&gt; 00:11:07.650\\nruss altman: There is a company that will use a commercial kid to look at your just your Y chromosome.\\n\\n63\\n00:11:09.150 --&gt; 00:11:19.560\\nruss altman: To tell you which version of the Y chromosome. You have now I will remind you that you get your Y chromosome from your biological father\\n\\n64\\n00:11:20.100 --&gt; 00:11:34.350\\nruss altman: And the kid knew this. So he said, Okay, I&#x27;m gonna find out about my Y chromosome that doesn&#x27;t tell you who your father is you know there&#x27;s 30 or 40 or 50 Y chromosome types, but obviously there&#x27;s a lot of people. However, this website.\\n\\n65\\n00:11:35.520 --&gt; 00:11:47.370\\nruss altman: This company had a website where if you gave up your last name, it would tell you other men who had the same pattern or variation in their Y chromosome. Now, you\\n\\n66\\n00:11:48.600 --&gt; 00:11:57.600\\nruss altman: The other thing you get from your dad in a petrol lineal society is their last name, which is which is what the UK is and was for the most part.\\n\\n67\\n00:11:58.320 --&gt; 00:12:07.170\\nruss altman: So this young man figured out that even if his biological father had not done this Y chromosome analysis.\\n\\n68\\n00:12:07.440 --&gt; 00:12:15.630\\nruss altman: There might be other people from that same family tree with the same Y chromosome, who would share the same last name.\\n\\n69\\n00:12:15.990 --&gt; 00:12:22.980\\nruss altman: So the kid got on the website gave his last name, which was irrelevant. It was whatever his mother&#x27;s or his adoptive father&#x27;s name was\\n\\n70\\n00:12:23.550 --&gt; 00:12:44.880\\nruss altman: But what he found out was all the names associated with that Y chromosome, and he could take the most common one and figure out, ah, this last name that that I&#x27;m seeing most commonly with this Y chromosome is probably my biological father&#x27;s last name. Oh, did we freeze.\\n\\n71\\n00:12:46.800 --&gt; 00:12:53.070\\nruss altman: I think we froze. So I&#x27;m going to stop here and restart because I don&#x27;t want to redo this part of the lecture.\\n\\n72\\n00:12:54.510 --&gt; 00:12:58.380\\nruss altman: But he figured out his last name.\\n\\n73\\n00:12:59.460 --&gt; 00:13:07.680\\nruss altman: Now he knew the county, the year M. The last name. He looked in the phone book he found two people with the same pattern.\\n\\n74\\n00:13:07.980 --&gt; 00:13:16.410\\nruss altman: He called one of them and said, Are you my father. And the guy said, I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about, and hung up, and he called the other one instead. Are you my father, and there was a long pause.\\n\\n75\\n00:13:16.920 --&gt; 00:13:24.510\\nruss altman: Bingo. You found your father, so he can find the he can find the information about age region of birth and year\\n\\n76\\n00:13:25.050 --&gt; 00:13:35.790\\nruss altman: To contact his father, so he really identified this guy who 15 YEARS AGO. GAVE sperm and thought he would never hear about it again, great example. And I&#x27;ll be back with the rest of the module.\\n\\n&quot;, &#x27;GMT20200407-010344_BioE-131-M.transcript.txt&#x27;: &quot;WEBVTT\\n\\n1\\n00:00:02.429 --&gt; 00:00:04.859\\nruss altman: Welcome to Module 11 hello, David.\\n\\n2\\n00:00:05.370 --&gt; 00:00:06.089\\nA Ross.\\n\\n3\\n00:00:07.500 --&gt; 00:00:08.099\\nDavid Magnus: Ready.\\n\\n4\\n00:00:08.610 --&gt; 00:00:13.290\\nDavid Magnus: Away. Today we&#x27;re gonna be talking about the uses of blood spots in research.\\n\\n5\\n00:00:15.120 --&gt; 00:00:27.300\\nDavid Magnus: So California law currently allows a theoretically parents to opt out, but almost none of them know that they can opt out of the uses for research. So in practice they don&#x27;t really have any option.\\n\\n6\\n00:00:28.350 --&gt; 00:00:38.460\\nDavid Magnus: There are people who make a lot of arguments, both in favor and against obtaining consent from people for allowing their uses and research and we&#x27;re going to just summarize some of those arguments.\\n\\n7\\n00:00:40.080 --&gt; 00:00:48.480\\nDavid Magnus: So first of all, there are some regulatory arguments against using a blood spots without consent first\\n\\n8\\n00:00:49.140 --&gt; 00:00:59.130\\nDavid Magnus: How is it even possible to use tissue from somebody without their consent. Well, the law allows the use of of material.\\n\\n9\\n00:00:59.790 --&gt; 00:01:08.580\\nDavid Magnus: As long as it&#x27;s de identified. So as long as the researchers don&#x27;t know who it&#x27;s from. Then under the current regulations that require that we get\\n\\n10\\n00:01:09.300 --&gt; 00:01:21.600\\nDavid Magnus: Informed consent for research, which we talked about earlier in the course, those regulations don&#x27;t apply because unless it&#x27;s identifiable. It doesn&#x27;t count as human subjects research.\\n\\n11\\n00:01:22.920 --&gt; 00:01:28.770\\nDavid Magnus: However, for this and this has really been the basis of why a lot of this blood spot. Research has taken place.\\n\\n12\\n00:01:29.010 --&gt; 00:01:37.890\\nDavid Magnus: However, and we&#x27;re going to be talking about this issue of re identification in much more detail in a future class, but the idea that you could have data.\\n\\n13\\n00:01:38.220 --&gt; 00:01:53.130\\nDavid Magnus: And especially genomic data and claim that it&#x27;s the identified has become increasingly problematic. And what that means is that the loophole in a way that people have been using to justify research without consent.\\n\\n14\\n00:01:54.630 --&gt; 00:01:56.730\\nDavid Magnus: Is getting harder and harder to maintain\\n\\n15\\n00:01:57.810 --&gt; 00:01:59.970\\nDavid Magnus: And some of the new regulations governing\\n\\n16\\n00:02:01.080 --&gt; 00:02:09.720\\nDavid Magnus: Research with blood spots explicitly says we should think of these things as identifiable therefore that loophole goes away.\\n\\n17\\n00:02:10.620 --&gt; 00:02:19.140\\nDavid Magnus: In addition to this regulatory argument. There&#x27;s also an ethical argument against using samples for research without consent.\\n\\n18\\n00:02:20.130 --&gt; 00:02:34.650\\nDavid Magnus: A lot of bioethicists have have done studies and surveys and they show that most of the public wants to be asked for permission before their samples are used. In fact, the people behind the campaigns in Minnesota.\\n\\n19\\n00:02:34.980 --&gt; 00:02:40.890\\nDavid Magnus: And in Texas that led to the destruction of their blood spots what the leaders all said was\\n\\n20\\n00:02:41.160 --&gt; 00:02:53.520\\nDavid Magnus: I would have consented, and let you use my blood spots, but doing it without buying permission is just wrong, and therefore I we bought these blood spot should be thrown out and you shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to do this unless you ask for permission first.\\n\\n21\\n00:02:55.860 --&gt; 00:02:58.650\\nDavid Magnus: privacy rights regarding control of this information.\\n\\n22\\n00:02:59.670 --&gt; 00:03:05.220\\nDavid Magnus: suggests a violation. So that&#x27;s the ontological concern that this is a violation of them as individuals.\\n\\n23\\n00:03:05.610 --&gt; 00:03:20.730\\nDavid Magnus: Moreover, it&#x27;s really important that the public have trust in the research community and we know that consent can play an important role in that process, a group of researchers led by Jeff Bob can have done a study of\\n\\n24\\n00:03:22.080 --&gt; 00:03:30.270\\nDavid Magnus: Of thinking about how what the best approach to this is when they looked at all the empirical studies of public attitudes parental attitudes.\\n\\n25\\n00:03:30.510 --&gt; 00:03:36.720\\nDavid Magnus: When they look at all the guideline statements from professional bodies as well as actual state policies.\\n\\n26\\n00:03:37.320 --&gt; 00:03:48.810\\nDavid Magnus: They use that as a basis for an expert working group and the result was that they made some recommendations, though most people when you ask them prefer opt in consent, where you actually say Can I have permission.\\n\\n27\\n00:03:49.590 --&gt; 00:03:57.030\\nDavid Magnus: The group concluded that opt out consent was justifiable, that is, you would still ask for permission but the default\\n\\n28\\n00:03:57.930 --&gt; 00:04:09.000\\nDavid Magnus: Would be that they would that they were presumed to be in the research, unless they explicitly said, I don&#x27;t want to be a part of it. And this creates a little bit of a nudge using trace art, architecture in favor of it.\\n\\n29\\n00:04:09.540 --&gt; 00:04:15.060\\nruss altman: Just compose there. I believe there&#x27;s a ton of data that you get very different\\n\\n30\\n00:04:15.750 --&gt; 00:04:26.940\\nruss altman: numbers of people signing up in opt in versus opt out. So even though, in theory, saying opt in or opt out should lead to the same number, depending if you&#x27;re making your decisions solely on your preferences.\\n\\n31\\n00:04:27.480 --&gt; 00:04:36.360\\nruss altman: There&#x27;s a literature that shows that when you opt in, you get if it&#x27;s automatic opt in, you get way less people than if you automatically opt them out.\\n\\n32\\n00:04:36.870 --&gt; 00:04:46.980\\nDavid Magnus: That&#x27;s correct. That&#x27;s really why choice architecture and and preset preferences really work to have a different have an impact on on on people&#x27;s behavior.\\n\\n33\\n00:04:48.120 --&gt; 00:04:55.350\\nDavid Magnus: But, of course, the more robust that the opt out consent is, the more it gets like opt in.\\n\\n34\\n00:04:55.620 --&gt; 00:04:57.360\\nDavid Magnus: Then the less that impact has\\n\\n35\\n00:04:58.860 --&gt; 00:05:02.760\\nDavid Magnus: So, and, and one of the things that some of the researchers found is\\n\\n36\\n00:05:03.000 --&gt; 00:05:10.170\\nDavid Magnus: People who said, I think I should opt in. When explained why they didn&#x27;t think that was a good idea because you wouldn&#x27;t have robust enough numbers.\\n\\n37\\n00:05:10.380 --&gt; 00:05:23.340\\nDavid Magnus: The data wouldn&#x27;t be as useful. And what if we did a really robust opt out. Most people come around to saying opt out would be okay. And so that&#x27;s more or less the majority view in the bioethics community.\\n\\n38\\n00:05:23.820 --&gt; 00:05:30.060\\nDavid Magnus: But there are some important arguments in favor of using even unscented blood spots and maybe not requiring consent.\\n\\n39\\n00:05:31.410 --&gt; 00:05:39.240\\nDavid Magnus: Obviously, currently, it doesn&#x27;t count as human subjects under the regulations. If it&#x27;s the identified, but we&#x27;ve already seen that that may be problematic.\\n\\n40\\n00:05:40.380 --&gt; 00:05:49.830\\nDavid Magnus: But what some other arguments in favor include the fact that to some extent there, whether you consent or not. There has to be some research like activities.\\n\\n41\\n00:05:50.160 --&gt; 00:05:57.540\\nDavid Magnus: With blood spots, whether there&#x27;s consent or not. And that&#x27;s because even be to be able to order to use them for clinical purposes.\\n\\n42\\n00:05:57.810 --&gt; 00:06:06.570\\nDavid Magnus: You have to have quality assurance and quality improvement activities that take place on a regular basis to make sure that the test really work the way you think they do.\\n\\n43\\n00:06:06.870 --&gt; 00:06:17.820\\nDavid Magnus: And you, there is no way of opting out of that. So a very research like activity has to take place anyway, even without research and that QA QA work is\\n\\n44\\n00:06:18.510 --&gt; 00:06:28.110\\nDavid Magnus: Is outside of the regulatory system and so is allowed to be done. Moreover, the one of the worries that a lot of people have about creating even an opt out.\\n\\n45\\n00:06:28.830 --&gt; 00:06:41.760\\nDavid Magnus: consent process is that you will have less people in the databases and that that will lead to both less data less robust data and, especially, there&#x27;s a concern that that data may become\\n\\n46\\n00:06:42.180 --&gt; 00:06:53.610\\nDavid Magnus: wider and more educated and more middle class, middle class to athletes, because in general when you require consent even opt out consent, you wind up getting\\n\\n47\\n00:06:54.060 --&gt; 00:07:05.340\\nDavid Magnus: More people who are white signing up for research and you end up having less ethnic and racial minorities in groups that are underrepresented in research traditionally be included.\\n\\n48\\n00:07:06.630 --&gt; 00:07:08.700\\nDavid Magnus: Our colleague Carlos Bustamante\\n\\n49\\n00:07:09.780 --&gt; 00:07:11.130\\nDavid Magnus: This was must have been about\\n\\n50\\n00:07:12.210 --&gt; 00:07:21.780\\nDavid Magnus: Something like around eight or 10 years ago looked at genome wide association studies and at that time they were almost all done on people of European descent.\\n\\n51\\n00:07:22.110 --&gt; 00:07:28.020\\nDavid Magnus: A few years later, it got a little bit better in the US, but it was still about 96% or 94%\\n\\n52\\n00:07:28.890 --&gt; 00:07:37.230\\nDavid Magnus: From people of European descent in the research in the US and up until I would say, up until now there&#x27;s efforts to try to improve that with things like the\\n\\n53\\n00:07:37.530 --&gt; 00:07:53.940\\nDavid Magnus: All of us research program, but the truth is that most research repositories remain mostly middle class educated white people, which we know already know a lot about. And when you increase the consent requirements you make the the data more biased.\\n\\n54\\n00:07:54.330 --&gt; 00:08:00.480\\nruss altman: And saying if those underrepresented groups don&#x27;t trust the Healthcare Research Establishment\\n\\n55\\n00:08:01.620 --&gt; 00:08:06.090\\nruss altman: Is it really the right thing to do, to say, well, we&#x27;re going to take that choice away from you.\\n\\n56\\n00:08:06.390 --&gt; 00:08:10.500\\nDavid Magnus: So that&#x27;s a really great question. And that really relates to the question of really\\n\\n57\\n00:08:11.100 --&gt; 00:08:16.920\\nDavid Magnus: What establishes trust. And so the people who want to defend the unconsidered blood spots.\\n\\n58\\n00:08:17.220 --&gt; 00:08:26.460\\nDavid Magnus: Are skeptical that informed consent forms and a few lines and informed consent form that people barely read and sign or refuse to sign\\n\\n59\\n00:08:26.760 --&gt; 00:08:36.720\\nDavid Magnus: Really is a very powerful way of demonstrating respect for the research participants and that will we need to do is keep these people included in the research.\\n\\n60\\n00:08:36.960 --&gt; 00:08:50.160\\nDavid Magnus: Because unconsidered blood spots are the most diverse databases that we have for lunch genomic point of view, but to actually find other more meaningful ways of demonstrating respect for those populations.\\n\\n61\\n00:08:50.790 --&gt; 00:09:00.990\\nDavid Magnus: Rather than relying on a few lot you know a few maybe even just a few paragraphs of an informed consent form that&#x27;s probably not understand unless they&#x27;re their lawyers.\\n\\n62\\n00:09:01.920 --&gt; 00:09:08.970\\nDavid Magnus: There&#x27;s no evidence that anybody has ever been harmed. As a result of a stored sample for decades. So the risk is low.\\n\\n63\\n00:09:09.420 --&gt; 00:09:15.870\\nDavid Magnus: And another thing that&#x27;s really important is that there&#x27;s evidence that people do value the research.\\n\\n64\\n00:09:16.380 --&gt; 00:09:22.020\\nDavid Magnus: That&#x27;s being done. So on the one hand, we want to respect the fact that people are saying, I want to give consent.\\n\\n65\\n00:09:22.350 --&gt; 00:09:30.000\\nDavid Magnus: But people are also saying when you give those people surveys. I want there to be a robust database of research and for this research to take place.\\n\\n66\\n00:09:30.240 --&gt; 00:09:38.820\\nDavid Magnus: The same surveys show that very clearly and what&#x27;s happened is that the bioethics community has basically said we&#x27;re going to give priority to one preference over another.\\n\\n67\\n00:09:39.120 --&gt; 00:09:46.860\\nDavid Magnus: But people don&#x27;t really ask that question, so they don&#x27;t ask the people like well you want the research to take place and you also want to give consent.\\n\\n68\\n00:09:47.070 --&gt; 00:09:53.490\\nDavid Magnus: But those two things may be incompatible, to some extent, and if they don&#x27;t fit together. Which do you think is more important.\\n\\n69\\n00:09:53.760 --&gt; 00:10:01.620\\nDavid Magnus: That turns out to be very hard to study, it&#x27;s not been studied very much but we&#x27;ve gotten some surprising answers when we&#x27;ve tried to explore some of those issues.\\n\\n70\\n00:10:01.860 --&gt; 00:10:12.510\\nDavid Magnus: In a study that we did, we found that 70% of people said they&#x27;d be willing to forgo consent or or lower the consent requirements in order for research to be possible.\\n\\n71\\n00:10:12.780 --&gt; 00:10:17.790\\nruss altman: Let me just say that my pen just ran out of ink. So we&#x27;re on our own from here on out. But keep going.\\n\\n72\\n00:10:18.060 --&gt; 00:10:33.720\\nDavid Magnus: Okay, so I&#x27;ll just say that one of the other challenges is when you ask people for consent. If it&#x27;s very specific consent about each particular research project that really becomes impossible and would make the research databases useless.\\n\\n73\\n00:10:34.740 --&gt; 00:10:35.670\\nDavid Magnus: There you go. Got it back.\\n\\n74\\n00:10:36.390 --&gt; 00:10:38.220\\nruss altman: I unplugged it and plugged it back in.\\n\\n75\\n00:10:38.520 --&gt; 00:10:49.740\\nDavid Magnus: Okay, there we go. So, so, so, so, so specific consent really would make the research unusable because you couldn&#x27;t ask. Go, go back to\\n\\n76\\n00:10:50.040 --&gt; 00:10:56.550\\nDavid Magnus: The database. Go back to, to all the blood spots and try and track everybody down for every time a researcher wanted to use this\\n\\n77\\n00:10:56.790 --&gt; 00:11:05.400\\nDavid Magnus: Which would mean that if you were going to have consent at all. It would have to be a very broad consent, which, again, if you&#x27;re thinking about this as a way of demonstrating respect telling them.\\n\\n78\\n00:11:05.760 --&gt; 00:11:13.350\\nDavid Magnus: We&#x27;re going to do use your blood spots for research. We don&#x27;t know exactly what&#x27;s going to be done with them, they&#x27;ll be some kind of genomic or genetic analysis done\\n\\n79\\n00:11:13.620 --&gt; 00:11:21.360\\nDavid Magnus: We can&#x27;t really predict what it&#x27;s going to be, it doesn&#x27;t really tell you very much. If you have broad consent and and yet.\\n\\n80\\n00:11:22.560 --&gt; 00:11:32.880\\nDavid Magnus: If you don&#x27;t, if you try to, as I said, have specific consent for every research project, then it would actually make the research absolutely impossible to take place.\\n\\n81\\n00:11:33.810 --&gt; 00:11:40.050\\nDavid Magnus: So cheer, there&#x27;s a trade off. People want to give consent. They want the research to take place and they want to reap its benefits.\\n\\n82\\n00:11:40.830 --&gt; 00:11:48.450\\nDavid Magnus: So studying this issue is really something that we need to do more of to see what people think of, but we also need to be\\n\\n83\\n00:11:49.080 --&gt; 00:11:57.990\\nDavid Magnus: Aware of what our options are for trying to have data that&#x27;s truly diverse and useful for researchers\\n\\n84\\n00:11:58.560 --&gt; 00:12:04.770\\nDavid Magnus: While also being respectful to participants. There&#x27;s one last wrinkle. I just want to mention, and that is\\n\\n85\\n00:12:05.550 --&gt; 00:12:17.400\\nDavid Magnus: So far we&#x27;ve been talking about this in the US context, but at least some other countries, and there&#x27;s always the potential in this country as well that there could be negative associations with some of this. So for example, in China.\\n\\n86\\n00:12:17.910 --&gt; 00:12:26.610\\nDavid Magnus: Police collected biometric information and samples of 19 million people who were being a press who are Muslims\\n\\n87\\n00:12:27.570 --&gt; 00:12:30.480\\nDavid Magnus: And using some of these technologies to try and figure out\\n\\n88\\n00:12:31.170 --&gt; 00:12:38.670\\nDavid Magnus: Who, who, people were from their DNA and to try and figure out facial patterns that they would expect to see what people would look like from their DNA.\\n\\n89\\n00:12:38.940 --&gt; 00:12:53.250\\nDavid Magnus: So they could identify them from seeing them in crowds and things like that. So there&#x27;s definitely the potential that this technology could be abused by the state or by other commercial entities and so we need to be aware of the fact that that that\\n\\n90\\n00:12:54.300 --&gt; 00:13:12.630\\nDavid Magnus: Doing this in a respectful manner requires that the uses of it be protected and some of the mechanisms for doing that include things like having really important and good governance and oversight of this research so that these kinds of uses. Don&#x27;t take place.\\n\\n91\\n00:13:14.100 --&gt; 00:13:15.000\\nDavid Magnus: And that&#x27;s it.\\n\\n92\\n00:13:15.870 --&gt; 00:13:23.160\\nruss altman: That was it. Thank you very much, the issues related to using blood spots for research. Sorry about the little pen.\\n\\n93\\n00:13:24.300 --&gt; 00:13:29.010\\nruss altman: Issue, but we will stop the share and we will stop the meeting. Thanks.\\n\\n&quot;}})\n",

It had been widely assumed that if you have like 1000 people&#x27;s DNA in a mixture and this was somebody studied this because of forensics. Let&#x27;s say you have a\\n\\n3\\n00:00:39.180 --&gt; 00:00:43.140\\nruss altman: Person who&#x27;s not allowed to go to children&#x27;s parks, because they were a sex offender.\\n\\n4\\n00:00:44.490 --&gt; 00:00:56.880\\nruss altman: And you collected DNA at the park.

And I just want to give you a sense for how where it comes from.\\n\\n9\\n00:01:44.190 --&gt; 00:01:55.260\\nruss altman: Okay I froze again and that irritates me so I&#x27;m just going to stop the share and restart the share hoping that that solves this problem apologize for this.\\n\\n10\\n00:02:01.260 --&gt; 00:02:03.750\\nruss altman: All right, let&#x27;s see if we can go to the next slide.\\n\\n11\\n00:02:13.050 --&gt; 00:02:18.510\\nruss altman: I do not want to draw that much I mostly want to get in back into my lecture, please.\\n\\n12\\n00:02:23.250 --&gt; 00:02:26.040\\nruss altman: So bush league Ross.\\n\\n13\\n00:02:27.120 --&gt; 00:02:37.830\\nruss altman: How did they do it statistics. So they have a million measurements of the invalid individual, for example, there&#x27;s an A deposition 3432\\n\\n14\\n00:02:39.570 --&gt; 00:02:45.030\\nruss altman: So let&#x27;s assume that 10% of all people in the general population have an A and 90% of a tea.\\n\\n15\\n00:02:45.750 --&gt; 00:03:09.810\\nruss altman: Now you have a million measurements of a mixture of 1000 other people have a mixture of 1000 people from that population. Okay, so let&#x27;s say that in those thousand people. There&#x27;s a 15% rate of a, an attempt at 5% rate of tea at that same position. Now our person had an A at at that position.\\n\\n16\\n00:03:11.250 --&gt; 00:03:14.340\\nruss altman: And you&#x27;re seeing slightly more A&#x27;s.\\n\\n17\\n00:03:15.690 --&gt; 00:03:20.310\\nruss altman: In the mixture than you are in the population at large.\\n\\n18\\n00:03:21.360 --&gt; 00:03:22.320\\nruss altman: Versus 10\\n\\n19\\n00:03:23.370 --&gt; 00:03:34.590\\nruss altman: So this person could have contributed that slight bit of extra a to the mixture does approve anything. Absolutely not.\\n\\n20\\n00:03:34.980 --&gt; 00:03:47.040\\nruss altman: First of all, they could not be in the mixture. Second of all, they could not be contributing to the X ray, but it increases the chance that they were in the mixture a tiny, tiny, tiny bit.\\n\\n21\\n00:03:48.270 --&gt; 00:03:54.870\\nruss altman: Now, so it&#x27;s slightly more probable that that individual is in, then they&#x27;re out\\n\\n22\\n00:03:56.340 --&gt; 00:04:03.600\\nruss altman: Now this is where your intuition loses you though because we have a million such measurements.\\n\\n23\\n00:04:04.020 --&gt; 00:04:15.030\\nruss altman: So every one of these tiny things that&#x27;s either in favor or against the hypothesis that they&#x27;re in the mixture adds up. And it turns out that somewhere around\\n\\n24\\n00:04:15.900 --&gt; 00:04:27.330\\nruss altman: 200 300,000 of these measurements you are positive that that person is either in or out. And then the other 700,000 just serve to increase your certainty.\\n\\n25\\n00:04:28.770 --&gt; 00:04:40.770\\nruss altman: So that&#x27;s a that&#x27;s amazing and true and it showed that people&#x27;s intuitions about went about when DNA is safe in a mixture were wrong.\\n\\n26\\n00:04:41.190 --&gt; 00:04:44.430\\nruss altman: This cause shock waves throughout the National Institutes of Health.\\n\\n27\\n00:04:44.700 --&gt; 00:04:58.080\\nruss altman: Because they had databases, where they said, here is the summary data for 1000 people, they would say 15% 85% t and they thought they were fine. And they didn&#x27;t have to worry about anybody in that study being identified\\n\\n28\\n00:04:58.410 --&gt; 00:05:06.870\\nruss altman: But if you had the genome of one of those 1000 people you could run it through the NIH database. And you could figure out if that person.\\n\\n29\\n00:05:07.230 --&gt; 00:05:09.000\\nruss altman: Participated in a study or not.\\n\\n30\\n00:05:09.390 --&gt; 00:05:21.420\\nruss altman: Why would we care about this. Well, let&#x27;s say the person signed up for a study with a sensitive diagnosis. They were sensitive about the disease that they had, they didn&#x27;t really want the rest of the world to know or their ensures or their employers.\\n\\n31\\n00:05:21.660 --&gt; 00:05:27.930\\nruss altman: And now there&#x27;s a way for somebody to figure out if they&#x27;re part of that mixture and therefore if they might have that disease.\\n\\n32\\n00:05:30.030 --&gt; 00:05:41.940\\nruss altman: This became clear and there was a New York Times article in 2013 where they showed that people could use genetics, plus the state and their age to re identify people\\n\\n33\\n00:05:42.930 --&gt; 00:05:47.700\\nruss altman: And these kinds of articles now are routinely appearing in the New York Times, showing that\\n\\n34\\n00:05:48.180 --&gt; 00:06:10.800\\nruss altman: People&#x27;s assumptions about their privacy with respect to their DNA are in many cases wrong and we really as a society need to discuss what should be the rules. So I just want to leave you with this. I should have mentioned this before I want to tell you about a law. It&#x27;s called the genetic\\n\\n35\\n00:06:13.170 --&gt; 00:06:14.370\\nruss altman: Information\\n\\n36\\n00:06:17.760 --&gt; 00:06:21.780\\nruss altman: Non discrimination act on this.\\n\\n37\\n00:06:23.130 --&gt; 00:06:24.780\\nruss altman: Whoa, let&#x27;s, let&#x27;s, a\\n\\n38\\n00:06:28.170 --&gt; 00:06:31.050\\nruss altman: Non discrimination.\\n\\n39\\n00:06:32.490 --&gt; 00:06:34.320\\nruss altman: Act or Gina\\n\\n40\\n00:06:36.750 --&gt; 00:06:44.250\\nruss altman: Gina was passed to say that you cannot discriminate against people based on their genetic data because the genetic data.\\n\\n41\\n00:06:44.610 --&gt; 00:06:57.240\\nruss altman: Often is manipulating probabilities, but it&#x27;s not giving anything that&#x27;s definite, even if it is definite though it&#x27;s not clear that you should hold it against people in employment or other forms of\\n\\n42\\n00:06:59.190 --&gt; 00:07:07.950\\nruss altman: Of financial transactions Gina is a pretty good act, but it&#x27;s limited because it does not cover disability insurance.\\n\\n43\\n00:07:11.070 --&gt; 00:07:21.750\\nruss altman: And it does not cover life insurance so they can still they being the insurance companies can still discriminate you when they&#x27;re making decisions about life insurance or disability insurance.\\n\\n44\\n00:07:22.110 --&gt; 00:07:26.040\\nruss altman: But they can&#x27;t use it for health insurance. And so that&#x27;s a big one.\\n\\n45\\n00:07:26.730 --&gt; 00:07:32.790\\nruss altman: Because now pre existing genetic information can be used to raise your rates or deny health insurance.\\n\\n46\\n00:07:33.120 --&gt; 00:07:49.980\\nruss altman: So, Gina is imperfect, but it&#x27;s a step in the right direction. Many people think most people believe that we should get rid of these exceptions and maybe we&#x27;ll talk about it in class. Okay, that&#x27;s the end of this second half of module 22\\n\\n&quot;, &#x27;GMT20200420-171758_BioE-131-M.transcript.txt&#x27;: &quot;WEBVTT\\n\\n1\\n00:00:03.179 --&gt; 00:00:08.400\\nruss altman: A bio 131. This is Russ in module 22\\n\\n2\\n00:00:09.719 --&gt; 00:00:22.200\\nruss altman: Now this is not a tech briefing module, but this is Russ, so you&#x27;re not going to get the kind of deep ethical analysis that David usually gives but hopefully we will get you close to ethics.\\n\\n3\\n00:00:22.980 --&gt; 00:00:35.760\\nruss altman: So that we can have a good discussion in class. And so you can think about these things. So this is not being labeled a technical briefing module, but you&#x27;ll see that it has more of the flavor of technical stuff and less of the ethics stuff. So whatever\\n\\n4\\n00:00:36.420 --&gt; 00:00:42.000\\nruss altman: And I hope you&#x27;re all having a good hair day you know hair is becoming an issue for all of us without any haircuts being available and so\\n\\n5\\n00:00:42.900 --&gt; 00:00:56.490\\nruss altman: A re identify ability. This is the idea that people create databases that they think are secure and which cannot have any of the individual participants be re identify\\n\\n6\\n00:00:57.360 --&gt; 00:01:07.080\\nruss altman: And cannot have any of the participants identified, but it&#x27;s false, because bottom line for this module is that\\n\\n7\\n00:01:07.620 --&gt; 00:01:16.530\\nruss altman: Sets of databases can be combined to figure out who is in a database, even if an individual database seems to be secure.\\n\\n8\\n00:01:17.490 --&gt; 00:01:23.790\\nruss altman: So in the technical briefing module. I talked about pharmacogenomics. And this database farm GK be that we&#x27;re building and we got worried\\n\\n9\\n00:01:24.120 --&gt; 00:01:34.230\\nruss altman: Because we were a genetic database. We were supporting research and we had DNA from subjects and we also had phenotype data. Most of the phenotype data was how they responded to drugs.\\n\\n10\\n00:01:35.070 --&gt; 00:01:42.120\\nruss altman: As I said in the last module is about 10 million locations in the genome. And one of the calculations we did and we published this\\n\\n11\\n00:01:42.780 --&gt; 00:01:52.230\\nruss altman: Was that even though there are 10 million locations you only need 60 to 100 of these snips. Remember the snips, the single base pair switches\\n\\n12\\n00:01:52.680 --&gt; 00:02:03.480\\nruss altman: If you tell me 100 positions in your genome and which letter you have that&#x27;s enough typically for you to be unique, other than a\\n\\n13\\n00:02:04.470 --&gt; 00:02:16.380\\nruss altman: Other than a a identical twin. So that was a wake up call for everybody because it was like, wow, you don&#x27;t need a very big piece of DNA to make it like a fingerprint now.\\n\\n14\\n00:02:16.830 --&gt; 00:02:26.520\\nruss altman: The thing is just because you have the DNA and you sequence it and you know those hundred measurements that doesn&#x27;t tell you who the person is unless there&#x27;s another database.\\n\\n15\\n00:02:26.880 --&gt; 00:02:33.630\\nruss altman: That has either the person&#x27;s identification and their DNA. So you could match up the DNA and figure out who the person is\\n\\n16\\n00:02:34.140 --&gt; 00:02:43.860\\nruss altman: Or if it has enough information about that person without giving you their actual name. There&#x27;s enough information for you to figure out their name like\\n\\n17\\n00:02:44.460 --&gt; 00:02:57.630\\nruss altman: All of their geo locations over the last period of time or all of their purchases on Amazon. Again, not as easy as looking up a name. But if you are motivated and if you have a lot of data, you may be able to figure out who they are.\\n\\n18\\n00:02:57.960 --&gt; 00:03:01.890\\nruss altman: And this is what this is about, particularly in the context of genetic data.\\n\\n19\\n00:03:02.700 --&gt; 00:03:13.710\\nruss altman: So as I said, if the genetic data can be associated with the phenotype data, then you might be able to figure out who&#x27;s in a study and I&#x27;ll give you some examples. So we can make it real.\\n\\n20\\n00:03:14.190 --&gt; 00:03:28.620\\nruss altman: In fact, there are examples before DNA was a thing or before it was, you know, measured routinely. There&#x27;s a couple of great cases. My favorite case is the governor of Massachusetts. Well, this was about 20 years ago.\\n\\n21\\n00:03:29.850 --&gt; 00:03:42.480\\nruss altman: He released public health records. And he said, This is great. He said, We&#x27;re going to catalyze research and public health. We&#x27;ve removed all the names and birthdays and addresses.\\n\\n22\\n00:03:43.350 --&gt; 00:03:46.500\\nruss altman: Detailed addresses so you don&#x27;t have to worry about your privacy.\\n\\n23\\n00:03:47.490 --&gt; 00:03:55.680\\nruss altman: And of course, Massachusetts is the home for Harvard Medical School and many other medical schools, and this was going to be a great thing for Massachusetts to have this great data set.\\n\\n24\\n00:03:56.100 --&gt; 00:04:08.820\\nruss altman: Well, three days after governor weld released this data, a researcher at MIT, who was a privacy expert sent governor weld medical records to the Boston Globe.\\n\\n25\\n00:04:09.840 --&gt; 00:04:11.760\\nruss altman: In a beautiful, beautiful moment.\\n\\n26\\n00:04:12.930 --&gt; 00:04:23.940\\nruss altman: And so what did they do well. It was true that the names and addresses had been removed, but they showed that they could use the voter ID roles which are public.\\n\\n27\\n00:04:24.270 --&gt; 00:04:27.090\\nruss altman: And the Department of Motor Vehicle roles which are public.\\n\\n28\\n00:04:27.390 --&gt; 00:04:40.830\\nruss altman: To figure out governor welds age his birthday, where he lives and then the one other thing they had was, they actually the Boston Globe itself had published at peace, saying that the governor had been to the doctor on a certain day\\n\\n29\\n00:04:41.070 --&gt; 00:04:57.450\\nruss altman: And had a clean bill of health. It was like a little public interest piece, but then they knew at least one day when somebody of Governor weld age and in his neighborhood went to a physician that generated a bill and with all of that and the bill was in the public health data.\\n\\n30\\n00:04:58.830 --&gt; 00:05:07.560\\nruss altman: So those data sets, they were able to combine and figure out that that was the governor. Now, could they do this for everybody. Well,\\n\\n31\\n00:05:07.800 --&gt; 00:05:25.980\\nruss altman: Not routinely because we all don&#x27;t have our visits to the doctor put into the Boston Globe, but we all do certain things on Facebook or whatever that might give somebody a clue that would allow them to re identify a data set that otherwise seemed like it might be private and de identified\\n\\n32\\n00:05:27.690 --&gt; 00:05:39.720\\nruss altman: The same researcher went on to show that there&#x27;s a problem in the medical literature with rare diseases. So they, in this case, they went to the New England Journal of Medicine, you know, one of the fanciest medical research journals.\\n\\n33\\n00:05:40.740 --&gt; 00:05:52.320\\nruss altman: And they had like the University of Chicago. I believe had done a study on a rare disease and they had included DNA sequence in in the article.\\n\\n34\\n00:05:53.490 --&gt; 00:06:06.810\\nruss altman: And it was long enough so that it had lots of these snips. Now, my colleague by the way this is Tanya Sweeney, who now. I think I don&#x27;t know where she is now. She had, she had been at MIT. She went to\\n\\n35\\n00:06:08.940 --&gt; 00:06:14.220\\nruss altman: She went to Penn and I think she might be at Harvard. I&#x27;m confused about where she is. But she&#x27;s great.\\n\\n36\\n00:06:15.810 --&gt; 00:06:24.870\\nruss altman: She figured that well let&#x27;s just look at the Chicago area probably people who go to the University of Chicago. Medical Center are in the Chicago area.\\n\\n37\\n00:06:25.080 --&gt; 00:06:33.240\\nruss altman: So, and this is a rare disease. So when she went to the public health records. There was not hundreds and hundreds of people with these diseases, there was like four\\n\\n38\\n00:06:33.630 --&gt; 00:06:45.210\\nruss altman: And then they sit the in the in the New England Journal article the the investigators had also said, oh, and this is a five year old little girl when I, you know, five year old little girl rare diagnosis.\\n\\n39\\n00:06:46.140 --&gt; 00:06:53.430\\nruss altman: Now you know some of that girls little DNA sequence know her DNA was perfectly normal size of the little girl was little.\\n\\n40\\n00:06:54.090 --&gt; 00:07:03.330\\nruss altman: But, you know, now who that patient probably was. Now, of course, my colleague didn&#x27;t do anything nefarious with its information, but she did publish\\n\\n41\\n00:07:03.720 --&gt; 00:07:13.530\\nruss altman: On the fact that there are these risks that people are taking that they might not fully realize when they provide data in such a way that it could be\\n\\n42\\n00:07:14.460 --&gt; 00:07:24.900\\nruss altman: Used to re identify subjects we always ask or we like to think that we always ask patients if we can use their data for research and we&#x27;re very grateful when they consent.\\n\\n43\\n00:07:25.830 --&gt; 00:07:38.940\\nruss altman: But part of that consent is usually a some sort of guarantee that their identity will be kept private and now there&#x27;s a real question about whether you should make a guarantee.\\n\\n44\\n00:07:39.660 --&gt; 00:07:49.920\\nruss altman: Versus just say we&#x27;re going to make best effort to keep your identity private. But these kinds of things can happen. And we would be lying if we said that we can absolutely guaranteed privacy.\\n\\n45\\n00:07:52.170 --&gt; 00:07:56.490\\nruss altman: So we wrote a paper about this, as I said, this is now super old 16 years old.\\n\\n46\\n00:07:58.380 --&gt; 00:08:06.810\\nruss altman: ardo and isn&#x27;t statistics here Jen was a graduate student and we talked about this trade off between genomic research and human subject privacy.\\n\\n47\\n00:08:07.350 --&gt; 00:08:18.960\\nruss altman: So this is the paper where we did the calculation that 60 to 100 snips are basically unique any 60 to 100 snips are basically unique for a person\\n\\n48\\n00:08:19.650 --&gt; 00:08:33.660\\nruss altman: And then we wrote it up as a Policy Forum, because although they liked our scientific finding they thought the more important message might be about what does this mean for a policy about genetic genetic privacy.\\n\\n49\\n00:08:35.190 --&gt; 00:08:47.280\\nruss altman: So here is the EU, I have to delete some of that some of that writing here is the main graph which we came up with it is extremely simple but they liked it.\\n\\n50\\n00:08:48.450 --&gt; 00:08:53.550\\nruss altman: On the x axis. It&#x27;s the number of snips that are measured\\n\\n51\\n00:08:54.960 --&gt; 00:09:02.700\\nruss altman: And on the y axis is a, I would say a qualitative metric of privacy being low, medium, and high\\n\\n52\\n00:09:03.420 --&gt; 00:09:15.150\\nruss altman: Not my most quantitative moment of my career, but what we showed is if you want high privacy. You can only release tiny, tiny amounts of your DNA for any kind of guarantee\\n\\n53\\n00:09:15.600 --&gt; 00:09:21.600\\nruss altman: And as soon as you get up to 100 snips or beyond your privacy is low.\\n\\n54\\n00:09:22.080 --&gt; 00:09:39.030\\nruss altman: But that is precisely where we are going to make discoveries. So we really want to be out here to the far right, which means we have a problem with our guarantees of privacy, which we really should not make and that was the main point of that article.\\n\\n55\\n00:09:43.650 --&gt; 00:09:58.170\\nruss altman: So then comes my one of my favorite stories. I was giving a talk like this, but I didn&#x27;t have a great example of anybody actually using genetic information to re identify and then there was this great story and the, what is that UK\\n\\n56\\n00:09:59.280 --&gt; 00:10:12.180\\nruss altman: That London based, I want to say, The Daily Mail or the or the Guardian one of those had this great story about a teenager in the UK who figured out who his sperm donor father was\\n\\n57\\n00:10:13.080 --&gt; 00:10:29.730\\nruss altman: This team was my hero. So the father donate sperm anonymously 15 years ago he gets some money and they tell him that he will be forever anonymous. The only thing they&#x27;re ever going to give out. And this was their huge mistake was they were going to give out\\n\\n58\\n00:10:31.980 --&gt; 00:10:32.580\\nruss altman: Whoops.\\n\\n59\\n00:10:34.230 --&gt; 00:10:36.150\\nruss altman: The county where he was born.\\n\\n60\\n00:10:37.380 --&gt; 00:10:47.010\\nruss altman: And the year of his birth, and he said, Okay, you know that I come from a very populated County. And there was also many people born that year. Sounds Okay.\\n\\n61\\n00:10:47.520 --&gt; 00:10:57.450\\nruss altman: All right, so a woman gets a sperm donation has a baby baby grows up to be a teenager and is interested in his heritage and also and also smart.\\n\\n62\\n00:11:01.170 --&gt; 00:11:07.650\\nruss altman: There is a company that will use a commercial kid to look at your just your Y chromosome.\\n\\n63\\n00:11:09.150 --&gt; 00:11:19.560\\nruss altman: To tell you which version of the Y chromosome. You have now I will remind you that you get your Y chromosome from your biological father\\n\\n64\\n00:11:20.100 --&gt; 00:11:34.350\\nruss altman: And the kid knew this. So he said, Okay, I&#x27;m gonna find out about my Y chromosome that doesn&#x27;t tell you who your father is you know there&#x27;s 30 or 40 or 50 Y chromosome types, but obviously there&#x27;s a lot of people. However, this website.\\n\\n65\\n00:11:35.520 --&gt; 00:11:47.370\\nruss altman: This company had a website where if you gave up your last name, it would tell you other men who had the same pattern or variation in their Y chromosome. Now, you\\n\\n66\\n00:11:48.600 --&gt; 00:11:57.600\\nruss altman: The other thing you get from your dad in a petrol lineal society is their last name, which is which is what the UK is and was for the most part.\\n\\n67\\n00:11:58.320 --&gt; 00:12:07.170\\nruss altman: So this young man figured out that even if his biological father had not done this Y chromosome analysis.\\n\\n68\\n00:12:07.440 --&gt; 00:12:15.630\\nruss altman: There might be other people from that same family tree with the same Y chromosome, who would share the same last name.\\n\\n69\\n00:12:15.990 --&gt; 00:12:22.980\\nruss altman: So the kid got on the website gave his last name, which was irrelevant. It was whatever his mother&#x27;s or his adoptive father&#x27;s name was\\n\\n70\\n00:12:23.550 --&gt; 00:12:44.880\\nruss altman: But what he found out was all the names associated with that Y chromosome, and he could take the most common one and figure out, ah, this last name that that I&#x27;m seeing most commonly with this Y chromosome is probably my biological father&#x27;s last name. Oh, did we freeze.\\n\\n71\\n00:12:46.800 --&gt; 00:12:53.070\\nruss altman: I think we froze. So I&#x27;m going to stop here and restart because I don&#x27;t want to redo this part of the lecture.\\n\\n72\\n00:12:54.510 --&gt; 00:12:58.380\\nruss altman: But he figured out his last name.\\n\\n73\\n00:12:59.460 --&gt; 00:13:07.680\\nruss altman: Now he knew the county, the year M. The last name. He looked in the phone book he found two people with the same pattern.\\n\\n74\\n00:13:07.980 --&gt; 00:13:16.410\\nruss altman: He called one of them and said, Are you my father. And the guy said, I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about, and hung up, and he called the other one instead. Are you my father, and there was a long pause.\\n\\n75\\n00:13:16.920 --&gt; 00:13:24.510\\nruss altman: Bingo. You found your father, so he can find the he can find the information about age region of birth and year\\n\\n76\\n00:13:25.050 --&gt; 00:13:35.790\\nruss altman: To contact his father, so he really identified this guy who 15 YEARS AGO. GAVE sperm and thought he would never hear about it again, great example. And I&#x27;ll be back with the rest of the module.\\n\\n&quot;, &#x27;GMT20200407-010344_BioE-131-M.transcript.txt&#x27;: &quot;WEBVTT\\n\\n1\\n00:00:02.429 --&gt; 00:00:04.859\\nruss altman: Welcome to Module 11 hello, David.\\n\\n2\\n00:00:05.370 --&gt; 00:00:06.089\\nA Ross.\\n\\n3\\n00:00:07.500 --&gt; 00:00:08.099\\nDavid Magnus: Ready.\\n\\n4\\n00:00:08.610 --&gt; 00:00:13.290\\nDavid Magnus: Away. Today we&#x27;re gonna be talking about the uses of blood spots in research.\\n\\n5\\n00:00:15.120 --&gt; 00:00:27.300\\nDavid Magnus: So California law currently allows a theoretically parents to opt out, but almost none of them know that they can opt out of the uses for research. So in practice they don&#x27;t really have any option.\\n\\n6\\n00:00:28.350 --&gt; 00:00:38.460\\nDavid Magnus: There are people who make a lot of arguments, both in favor and against obtaining consent from people for allowing their uses and research and we&#x27;re going to just summarize some of those arguments.\\n\\n7\\n00:00:40.080 --&gt; 00:00:48.480\\nDavid Magnus: So first of all, there are some regulatory arguments against using a blood spots without consent first\\n\\n8\\n00:00:49.140 --&gt; 00:00:59.130\\nDavid Magnus: How is it even possible to use tissue from somebody without their consent. Well, the law allows the use of of material.\\n\\n9\\n00:00:59.790 --&gt; 00:01:08.580\\nDavid Magnus: As long as it&#x27;s de identified. So as long as the researchers don&#x27;t know who it&#x27;s from. Then under the current regulations that require that we get\\n\\n10\\n00:01:09.300 --&gt; 00:01:21.600\\nDavid Magnus: Informed consent for research, which we talked about earlier in the course, those regulations don&#x27;t apply because unless it&#x27;s identifiable. It doesn&#x27;t count as human subjects research.\\n\\n11\\n00:01:22.920 --&gt; 00:01:28.770\\nDavid Magnus: However, for this and this has really been the basis of why a lot of this blood spot. Research has taken place.\\n\\n12\\n00:01:29.010 --&gt; 00:01:37.890\\nDavid Magnus: However, and we&#x27;re going to be talking about this issue of re identification in much more detail in a future class, but the idea that you could have data.\\n\\n13\\n00:01:38.220 --&gt; 00:01:53.130\\nDavid Magnus: And especially genomic data and claim that it&#x27;s the identified has become increasingly problematic. And what that means is that the loophole in a way that people have been using to justify research without consent.\\n\\n14\\n00:01:54.630 --&gt; 00:01:56.730\\nDavid Magnus: Is getting harder and harder to maintain\\n\\n15\\n00:01:57.810 --&gt; 00:01:59.970\\nDavid Magnus: And some of the new regulations governing\\n\\n16\\n00:02:01.080 --&gt; 00:02:09.720\\nDavid Magnus: Research with blood spots explicitly says we should think of these things as identifiable therefore that loophole goes away.\\n\\n17\\n00:02:10.620 --&gt; 00:02:19.140\\nDavid Magnus: In addition to this regulatory argument. There&#x27;s also an ethical argument against using samples for research without consent.\\n\\n18\\n00:02:20.130 --&gt; 00:02:34.650\\nDavid Magnus: A lot of bioethicists have have done studies and surveys and they show that most of the public wants to be asked for permission before their samples are used. In fact, the people behind the campaigns in Minnesota.\\n\\n19\\n00:02:34.980 --&gt; 00:02:40.890\\nDavid Magnus: And in Texas that led to the destruction of their blood spots what the leaders all said was\\n\\n20\\n00:02:41.160 --&gt; 00:02:53.520\\nDavid Magnus: I would have consented, and let you use my blood spots, but doing it without buying permission is just wrong, and therefore I we bought these blood spot should be thrown out and you shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to do this unless you ask for permission first.\\n\\n21\\n00:02:55.860 --&gt; 00:02:58.650\\nDavid Magnus: privacy rights regarding control of this information.\\n\\n22\\n00:02:59.670 --&gt; 00:03:05.220\\nDavid Magnus: suggests a violation. So that&#x27;s the ontological concern that this is a violation of them as individuals.\\n\\n23\\n00:03:05.610 --&gt; 00:03:20.730\\nDavid Magnus: Moreover, it&#x27;s really important that the public have trust in the research community and we know that consent can play an important role in that process, a group of researchers led by Jeff Bob can have done a study of\\n\\n24\\n00:03:22.080 --&gt; 00:03:30.270\\nDavid Magnus: Of thinking about how what the best approach to this is when they looked at all the empirical studies of public attitudes parental attitudes.\\n\\n25\\n00:03:30.510 --&gt; 00:03:36.720\\nDavid Magnus: When they look at all the guideline statements from professional bodies as well as actual state policies.\\n\\n26\\n00:03:37.320 --&gt; 00:03:48.810\\nDavid Magnus: They use that as a basis for an expert working group and the result was that they made some recommendations, though most people when you ask them prefer opt in consent, where you actually say Can I have permission.\\n\\n27\\n00:03:49.590 --&gt; 00:03:57.030\\nDavid Magnus: The group concluded that opt out consent was justifiable, that is, you would still ask for permission but the default\\n\\n28\\n00:03:57.930 --&gt; 00:04:09.000\\nDavid Magnus: Would be that they would that they were presumed to be in the research, unless they explicitly said, I don&#x27;t want to be a part of it. And this creates a little bit of a nudge using trace art, architecture in favor of it.\\n\\n29\\n00:04:09.540 --&gt; 00:04:15.060\\nruss altman: Just compose there. I believe there&#x27;s a ton of data that you get very different\\n\\n30\\n00:04:15.750 --&gt; 00:04:26.940\\nruss altman: numbers of people signing up in opt in versus opt out. So even though, in theory, saying opt in or opt out should lead to the same number, depending if you&#x27;re making your decisions solely on your preferences.\\n\\n31\\n00:04:27.480 --&gt; 00:04:36.360\\nruss altman: There&#x27;s a literature that shows that when you opt in, you get if it&#x27;s automatic opt in, you get way less people than if you automatically opt them out.\\n\\n32\\n00:04:36.870 --&gt; 00:04:46.980\\nDavid Magnus: That&#x27;s correct. That&#x27;s really why choice architecture and and preset preferences really work to have a different have an impact on on on people&#x27;s behavior.\\n\\n33\\n00:04:48.120 --&gt; 00:04:55.350\\nDavid Magnus: But, of course, the more robust that the opt out consent is, the more it gets like opt in.\\n\\n34\\n00:04:55.620 --&gt; 00:04:57.360\\nDavid Magnus: Then the less that impact has\\n\\n35\\n00:04:58.860 --&gt; 00:05:02.760\\nDavid Magnus: So, and, and one of the things that some of the researchers found is\\n\\n36\\n00:05:03.000 --&gt; 00:05:10.170\\nDavid Magnus: People who said, I think I should opt in. When explained why they didn&#x27;t think that was a good idea because you wouldn&#x27;t have robust enough numbers.\\n\\n37\\n00:05:10.380 --&gt; 00:05:23.340\\nDavid Magnus: The data wouldn&#x27;t be as useful. And what if we did a really robust opt out. Most people come around to saying opt out would be okay. And so that&#x27;s more or less the majority view in the bioethics community.\\n\\n38\\n00:05:23.820 --&gt; 00:05:30.060\\nDavid Magnus: But there are some important arguments in favor of using even unscented blood spots and maybe not requiring consent.\\n\\n39\\n00:05:31.410 --&gt; 00:05:39.240\\nDavid Magnus: Obviously, currently, it doesn&#x27;t count as human subjects under the regulations. If it&#x27;s the identified, but we&#x27;ve already seen that that may be problematic.\\n\\n40\\n00:05:40.380 --&gt; 00:05:49.830\\nDavid Magnus: But what some other arguments in favor include the fact that to some extent there, whether you consent or not. There has to be some research like activities.\\n\\n41\\n00:05:50.160 --&gt; 00:05:57.540\\nDavid Magnus: With blood spots, whether there&#x27;s consent or not. And that&#x27;s because even be to be able to order to use them for clinical purposes.\\n\\n42\\n00:05:57.810 --&gt; 00:06:06.570\\nDavid Magnus: You have to have quality assurance and quality improvement activities that take place on a regular basis to make sure that the test really work the way you think they do.\\n\\n43\\n00:06:06.870 --&gt; 00:06:17.820\\nDavid Magnus: And you, there is no way of opting out of that. So a very research like activity has to take place anyway, even without research and that QA QA work is\\n\\n44\\n00:06:18.510 --&gt; 00:06:28.110\\nDavid Magnus: Is outside of the regulatory system and so is allowed to be done. Moreover, the one of the worries that a lot of people have about creating even an opt out.\\n\\n45\\n00:06:28.830 --&gt; 00:06:41.760\\nDavid Magnus: consent process is that you will have less people in the databases and that that will lead to both less data less robust data and, especially, there&#x27;s a concern that that data may become\\n\\n46\\n00:06:42.180 --&gt; 00:06:53.610\\nDavid Magnus: wider and more educated and more middle class, middle class to athletes, because in general when you require consent even opt out consent, you wind up getting\\n\\n47\\n00:06:54.060 --&gt; 00:07:05.340\\nDavid Magnus: More people who are white signing up for research and you end up having less ethnic and racial minorities in groups that are underrepresented in research traditionally be included.\\n\\n48\\n00:07:06.630 --&gt; 00:07:08.700\\nDavid Magnus: Our colleague Carlos Bustamante\\n\\n49\\n00:07:09.780 --&gt; 00:07:11.130\\nDavid Magnus: This was must have been about\\n\\n50\\n00:07:12.210 --&gt; 00:07:21.780\\nDavid Magnus: Something like around eight or 10 years ago looked at genome wide association studies and at that time they were almost all done on people of European descent.\\n\\n51\\n00:07:22.110 --&gt; 00:07:28.020\\nDavid Magnus: A few years later, it got a little bit better in the US, but it was still about 96% or 94%\\n\\n52\\n00:07:28.890 --&gt; 00:07:37.230\\nDavid Magnus: From people of European descent in the research in the US and up until I would say, up until now there&#x27;s efforts to try to improve that with things like the\\n\\n53\\n00:07:37.530 --&gt; 00:07:53.940\\nDavid Magnus: All of us research program, but the truth is that most research repositories remain mostly middle class educated white people, which we know already know a lot about. And when you increase the consent requirements you make the the data more biased.\\n\\n54\\n00:07:54.330 --&gt; 00:08:00.480\\nruss altman: And saying if those underrepresented groups don&#x27;t trust the Healthcare Research Establishment\\n\\n55\\n00:08:01.620 --&gt; 00:08:06.090\\nruss altman: Is it really the right thing to do, to say, well, we&#x27;re going to take that choice away from you.\\n\\n56\\n00:08:06.390 --&gt; 00:08:10.500\\nDavid Magnus: So that&#x27;s a really great question. And that really relates to the question of really\\n\\n57\\n00:08:11.100 --&gt; 00:08:16.920\\nDavid Magnus: What establishes trust. And so the people who want to defend the unconsidered blood spots.\\n\\n58\\n00:08:17.220 --&gt; 00:08:26.460\\nDavid Magnus: Are skeptical that informed consent forms and a few lines and informed consent form that people barely read and sign or refuse to sign\\n\\n59\\n00:08:26.760 --&gt; 00:08:36.720\\nDavid Magnus: Really is a very powerful way of demonstrating respect for the research participants and that will we need to do is keep these people included in the research.\\n\\n60\\n00:08:36.960 --&gt; 00:08:50.160\\nDavid Magnus: Because unconsidered blood spots are the most diverse databases that we have for lunch genomic point of view, but to actually find other more meaningful ways of demonstrating respect for those populations.\\n\\n61\\n00:08:50.790 --&gt; 00:09:00.990\\nDavid Magnus: Rather than relying on a few lot you know a few maybe even just a few paragraphs of an informed consent form that&#x27;s probably not understand unless they&#x27;re their lawyers.\\n\\n62\\n00:09:01.920 --&gt; 00:09:08.970\\nDavid Magnus: There&#x27;s no evidence that anybody has ever been harmed. As a result of a stored sample for decades. So the risk is low.\\n\\n63\\n00:09:09.420 --&gt; 00:09:15.870\\nDavid Magnus: And another thing that&#x27;s really important is that there&#x27;s evidence that people do value the research.\\n\\n64\\n00:09:16.380 --&gt; 00:09:22.020\\nDavid Magnus: That&#x27;s being done. So on the one hand, we want to respect the fact that people are saying, I want to give consent.\\n\\n65\\n00:09:22.350 --&gt; 00:09:30.000\\nDavid Magnus: But people are also saying when you give those people surveys. I want there to be a robust database of research and for this research to take place.\\n\\n66\\n00:09:30.240 --&gt; 00:09:38.820\\nDavid Magnus: The same surveys show that very clearly and what&#x27;s happened is that the bioethics community has basically said we&#x27;re going to give priority to one preference over another.\\n\\n67\\n00:09:39.120 --&gt; 00:09:46.860\\nDavid Magnus: But people don&#x27;t really ask that question, so they don&#x27;t ask the people like well you want the research to take place and you also want to give consent.\\n\\n68\\n00:09:47.070 --&gt; 00:09:53.490\\nDavid Magnus: But those two things may be incompatible, to some extent, and if they don&#x27;t fit together. Which do you think is more important.\\n\\n69\\n00:09:53.760 --&gt; 00:10:01.620\\nDavid Magnus: That turns out to be very hard to study, it&#x27;s not been studied very much but we&#x27;ve gotten some surprising answers when we&#x27;ve tried to explore some of those issues.\\n\\n70\\n00:10:01.860 --&gt; 00:10:12.510\\nDavid Magnus: In a study that we did, we found that 70% of people said they&#x27;d be willing to forgo consent or or lower the consent requirements in order for research to be possible.\\n\\n71\\n00:10:12.780 --&gt; 00:10:17.790\\nruss altman: Let me just say that my pen just ran out of ink. So we&#x27;re on our own from here on out. But keep going.\\n\\n72\\n00:10:18.060 --&gt; 00:10:33.720\\nDavid Magnus: Okay, so I&#x27;ll just say that one of the other challenges is when you ask people for consent. If it&#x27;s very specific consent about each particular research project that really becomes impossible and would make the research databases useless.\\n\\n73\\n00:10:34.740 --&gt; 00:10:35.670\\nDavid Magnus: There you go. Got it back.\\n\\n74\\n00:10:36.390 --&gt; 00:10:38.220\\nruss altman: I unplugged it and plugged it back in.\\n\\n75\\n00:10:38.520 --&gt; 00:10:49.740\\nDavid Magnus: Okay, there we go. So, so, so, so, so specific consent really would make the research unusable because you couldn&#x27;t ask. Go, go back to\\n\\n76\\n00:10:50.040 --&gt; 00:10:56.550\\nDavid Magnus: The database. Go back to, to all the blood spots and try and track everybody down for every time a researcher wanted to use this\\n\\n77\\n00:10:56.790 --&gt; 00:11:05.400\\nDavid Magnus: Which would mean that if you were going to have consent at all. It would have to be a very broad consent, which, again, if you&#x27;re thinking about this as a way of demonstrating respect telling them.\\n\\n78\\n00:11:05.760 --&gt; 00:11:13.350\\nDavid Magnus: We&#x27;re going to do use your blood spots for research. We don&#x27;t know exactly what&#x27;s going to be done with them, they&#x27;ll be some kind of genomic or genetic analysis done\\n\\n79\\n00:11:13.620 --&gt; 00:11:21.360\\nDavid Magnus: We can&#x27;t really predict what it&#x27;s going to be, it doesn&#x27;t really tell you very much. If you have broad consent and and yet.\\n\\n80\\n00:11:22.560 --&gt; 00:11:32.880\\nDavid Magnus: If you don&#x27;t, if you try to, as I said, have specific consent for every research project, then it would actually make the research absolutely impossible to take place.\\n\\n81\\n00:11:33.810 --&gt; 00:11:40.050\\nDavid Magnus: So cheer, there&#x27;s a trade off. People want to give consent. They want the research to take place and they want to reap its benefits.\\n\\n82\\n00:11:40.830 --&gt; 00:11:48.450\\nDavid Magnus: So studying this issue is really something that we need to do more of to see what people think of, but we also need to be\\n\\n83\\n00:11:49.080 --&gt; 00:11:57.990\\nDavid Magnus: Aware of what our options are for trying to have data that&#x27;s truly diverse and useful for researchers\\n\\n84\\n00:11:58.560 --&gt; 00:12:04.770\\nDavid Magnus: While also being respectful to participants. There&#x27;s one last wrinkle. I just want to mention, and that is\\n\\n85\\n00:12:05.550 --&gt; 00:12:17.400\\nDavid Magnus: So far we&#x27;ve been talking about this in the US context, but at least some other countries, and there&#x27;s always the potential in this country as well that there could be negative associations with some of this. So for example, in China.\\n\\n86\\n00:12:17.910 --&gt; 00:12:26.610\\nDavid Magnus: Police collected biometric information and samples of 19 million people who were being a press who are Muslims\\n\\n87\\n00:12:27.570 --&gt; 00:12:30.480\\nDavid Magnus: And using some of these technologies to try and figure out\\n\\n88\\n00:12:31.170 --&gt; 00:12:38.670\\nDavid Magnus: Who, who, people were from their DNA and to try and figure out facial patterns that they would expect to see what people would look like from their DNA.\\n\\n89\\n00:12:38.940 --&gt; 00:12:53.250\\nDavid Magnus: So they could identify them from seeing them in crowds and things like that. So there&#x27;s definitely the potential that this technology could be abused by the state or by other commercial entities and so we need to be aware of the fact that that that\\n\\n90\\n00:12:54.300 --&gt; 00:13:12.630\\nDavid Magnus: Doing this in a respectful manner requires that the uses of it be protected and some of the mechanisms for doing that include things like having really important and good governance and oversight of this research so that these kinds of uses. Don&#x27;t take place.\\n\\n91\\n00:13:14.100 --&gt; 00:13:15.000\\nDavid Magnus: And that&#x27;s it.\\n\\n92\\n00:13:15.870 --&gt; 00:13:23.160\\nruss altman: That was it. Thank you very much, the issues related to using blood spots for research. Sorry about the little pen.\\n\\n93\\n00:13:24.300 --&gt; 00:13:29.010\\nruss altman: Issue, but we will stop the share and we will stop the meeting. Thanks.\\n\\n&quot;}\n",

This is the second part of module 22 which froze in my PowerPoint. So you just heard the story about the team who found his father in the UK and US became my hero as a early case of DNA re identification.\\n\\n2\\n00:00:21.390 --&gt; 00:00:37.980\\nruss altman: The next thing I want to tell you about, which is worrisome is this idea of identifying individuals for in a mixture. It had been widely assumed that if you have like 1000 people&#x27;s DNA in a mixture and this was somebody studied this because of forensics. Let&#x27;s say you have a\\n\\n3\\n00:00:39.180 --&gt; 00:00:43.140\\nruss altman: Person who&#x27;s not allowed to go to children&#x27;s parks, because they were a sex offender.\\n\\n4\\n00:00:44.490 --&gt; 00:00:56.880\\nruss altman: And you collected DNA at the park. There&#x27;s no way you would be able to figure out if that person was one of the people who had been at that park and left some of their DNA that was an assumption which turned out to be wrong, and in\\n\\n5\\n00:00:58.350 --&gt; 00:01:05.820\\nruss altman: Homer at all published a paper showing that if you have the genome, the genetics of a single individual.\\n\\n6\\n00:01:06.810 --&gt; 00:01:19.320\\nruss altman: And they don&#x27;t even need the whole genome. They just need about a million snips and you can measure a million snips for like 200 bucks 23andMe does a million snips as part of their $99 genetic\\n\\n7\\n00:01:20.430 --&gt; 00:01:36.090\\nruss altman: rundown. So if you can have a million snips for a single individual. And then you have a mixture of 1000 individuals and you want to know is my individual part of that mixture, you can determine that with extremely high confidence.\\n\\n8\\n00:01:37.140 --&gt; 00:01:41.610\\nruss altman: That was a surprise to people. And I just want to give you a sense for how where it comes from.\\n\\n9\\n00:01:44.190 --&gt; 00:01:55.260\\nruss altman: Okay I froze again and that irritates me so I&#x27;m just going to stop the share and restart the share hoping that that solves this problem apologize for this.\\n\\n10\\n00:02:01.260 --&gt; 00:02:03.750\\nruss altman: All right, let&#x27;s see if we can go to the next slide.\\n\\n11\\n00:02:13.050 --&gt; 00:02:18.510\\nruss altman: I do not want to draw that much I mostly want to get in back into my lecture, please.\\n\\n12\\n00:02:23.250 --&gt; 00:02:26.040\\nruss altman: So bush league Ross.\\n\\n13\\n00:02:27.120 --&gt; 00:02:37.830\\nruss altman: How did they do it statistics. So they have a million measurements of the invalid individual, for example, there&#x27;s an A deposition 3432\\n\\n14\\n00:02:39.570 --&gt; 00:02:45.030\\nruss altman: So let&#x27;s assume that 10% of all people in the general population have an A and 90% of a tea.\\n\\n15\\n00:02:45.750 --&gt; 00:03:09.810\\nruss altman: Now you have a million measurements of a mixture of 1000 other people have a mixture of 1000 people from that population. Okay, so let&#x27;s say that in those thousand people. There&#x27;s a 15% rate of a, an attempt at 5% rate of tea at that same position. Now our person had an A at at that position.\\n\\n16\\n00:03:11.250 --&gt; 00:03:14.340\\nruss altman: And you&#x27;re seeing slightly more A&#x27;s.\\n\\n17\\n00:03:15.690 --&gt; 00:03:20.310\\nruss altman: In the mixture than you are in the population at large.\\n\\n18\\n00:03:21.360 --&gt; 00:03:22.320\\nruss altman: Versus 10\\n\\n19\\n00:03:23.370 --&gt; 00:03:34.590\\nruss altman: So this person could have contributed that slight bit of extra a to the mixture does approve anything. Absolutely not.\\n\\n20\\n00:03:34.980 --&gt; 00:03:47.040\\nruss altman: First of all, they could not be in the mixture. Second of all, they could not be contributing to the X ray, but it increases the chance that they were in the mixture a tiny, tiny, tiny bit.\\n\\n21\\n00:03:48.270 --&gt; 00:03:54.870\\nruss altman: Now, so it&#x27;s slightly more probable that that individual is in, then they&#x27;re out\\n\\n22\\n00:03:56.340 --&gt; 00:04:03.600\\nruss altman: Now this is where your intuition loses you though because we have a million such measurements.\\n\\n23\\n00:04:04.020 --&gt; 00:04:15.030\\nruss altman: So every one of these tiny things that&#x27;s either in favor or against the hypothesis that they&#x27;re in the mixture adds up. And it turns out that somewhere around\\n\\n24\\n00:04:15.900 --&gt; 00:04:27.330\\nruss altman: 200 300,000 of these measurements you are positive that that person is either in or out. And then the other 700,000 just serve to increase your certainty.\\n\\n25\\n00:04:28.770 --&gt; 00:04:40.770\\nruss altman: So that&#x27;s a that&#x27;s amazing and true and it showed that people&#x27;s intuitions about went about when DNA is safe in a mixture were wrong.\\n\\n26\\n00:04:41.190 --&gt; 00:04:44.430\\nruss altman: This cause shock waves throughout the National Institutes of Health.\\n\\n27\\n00:04:44.700 --&gt; 00:04:58.080\\nruss altman: Because they had databases, where they said, here is the summary data for 1000 people, they would say 15% 85% t and they thought they were fine. And they didn&#x27;t have to worry about anybody in that study being identified\\n\\n28\\n00:04:58.410 --&gt; 00:05:06.870\\nruss altman: But if you had the genome of one of those 1000 people you could run it through the NIH database. And you could figure out if that person.\\n\\n29\\n00:05:07.230 --&gt; 00:05:09.000\\nruss altman: Participated in a study or not.\\n\\n30\\n00:05:09.390 --&gt; 00:05:21.420\\nruss altman: Why would we care about this. Well, let&#x27;s say the person signed up for a study with a sensitive diagnosis. They were sensitive about the disease that they had, they didn&#x27;t really want the rest of the world to know or their ensures or their employers.\\n\\n31\\n00:05:21.660 --&gt; 00:05:27.930\\nruss altman: And now there&#x27;s a way for somebody to figure out if they&#x27;re part of that mixture and therefore if they might have that disease.\\n\\n32\\n00:05:30.030 --&gt; 00:05:41.940\\nruss altman: This became clear and there was a New York Times article in 2013 where they showed that people could use genetics, plus the state and their age to re identify people\\n\\n33\\n00:05:42.930 --&gt; 00:05:47.700\\nruss altman: And these kinds of articles now are routinely appearing in the New York Times, showing that\\n\\n34\\n00:05:48.180 --&gt; 00:06:10.800\\nruss altman: People&#x27;s assumptions about their privacy with respect to their DNA are in many cases wrong and we really as a society need to discuss what should be the rules. So I just want to leave you with this. I should have mentioned this before I want to tell you about a law. It&#x27;s called the genetic\\n\\n35\\n00:06:13.170 --&gt; 00:06:14.370\\nruss altman: Information\\n\\n36\\n00:06:17.760 --&gt; 00:06:21.780\\nruss altman: Non discrimination act on this.\\n\\n37\\n00:06:23.130 --&gt; 00:06:24.780\\nruss altman: Whoa, let&#x27;s, let&#x27;s, a\\n\\n38\\n00:06:28.170 --&gt; 00:06:31.050\\nruss altman: Non discrimination.\\n\\n39\\n00:06:32.490 --&gt; 00:06:34.320\\nruss altman: Act or Gina\\n\\n40\\n00:06:36.750 --&gt; 00:06:44.250\\nruss altman: Gina was passed to say that you cannot discriminate against people based on their genetic data because the genetic data.\\n\\n41\\n00:06:44.610 --&gt; 00:06:57.240\\nruss altman: Often is manipulating probabilities, but it&#x27;s not giving anything that&#x27;s definite, even if it is definite though it&#x27;s not clear that you should hold it against people in employment or other forms of\\n\\n42\\n00:06:59.190 --&gt; 00:07:07.950\\nruss altman: Of financial transactions Gina is a pretty good act, but it&#x27;s limited because it does not cover disability insurance.\\n\\n43\\n00:07:11.070 --&gt; 00:07:21.750\\nruss altman: And it does not cover life insurance so they can still they being the insurance companies can still discriminate you when they&#x27;re making decisions about life insurance or disability insurance.\\n\\n44\\n00:07:22.110 --&gt; 00:07:26.040\\nruss altman: But they can&#x27;t use it for health insurance. And so that&#x27;s a big one.\\n\\n45\\n00:07:26.730 --&gt; 00:07:32.790\\nruss altman: Because now pre existing genetic information can be used to raise your rates or deny health insurance.\\n\\n46\\n00:07:33.120 --&gt; 00:07:49.980\\nruss altman: So, Gina is imperfect, but it&#x27;s a step in the right direction. Many people think most people believe that we should get rid of these exceptions and maybe we&#x27;ll talk about it in class. Okay, that&#x27;s the end of this second half of module 22\\n\\n&quot;, &#x27;GMT20200420-171758_BioE-131-M.transcript.txt&#x27;: &quot;WEBVTT\\n\\n1\\n00:00:03.179 --&gt; 00:00:08.400\\nruss altman: A bio 131. This is Russ in module 22\\n\\n2\\n00:00:09.719 --&gt; 00:00:22.200\\nruss altman: Now this is not a tech briefing module, but this is Russ, so you&#x27;re not going to get the kind of deep ethical analysis that David usually gives but hopefully we will get you close to ethics.\\n\\n3\\n00:00:22.980 --&gt; 00:00:35.760\\nruss altman: So that we can have a good discussion in class. And so you can think about these things. So this is not being labeled a technical briefing module, but you&#x27;ll see that it has more of the flavor of technical stuff and less of the ethics stuff. So whatever\\n\\n4\\n00:00:36.420 --&gt; 00:00:42.000\\nruss altman: And I hope you&#x27;re all having a good hair day you know hair is becoming an issue for all of us without any haircuts being available and so\\n\\n5\\n00:00:42.900 --&gt; 00:00:56.490\\nruss altman: A re identify ability. This is the idea that people create databases that they think are secure and which cannot have any of the individual participants be re identify\\n\\n6\\n00:00:57.360 --&gt; 00:01:07.080\\nruss altman: And cannot have any of the participants identified, but it&#x27;s false, because bottom line for this module is that\\n\\n7\\n00:01:07.620 --&gt; 00:01:16.530\\nruss altman: Sets of databases can be combined to figure out who is in a database, even if an individual database seems to be secure.\\n\\n8\\n00:01:17.490 --&gt; 00:01:23.790\\nruss altman: So in the technical briefing module. I talked about pharmacogenomics. And this database farm GK be that we&#x27;re building and we got worried\\n\\n9\\n00:01:24.120 --&gt; 00:01:34.230\\nruss altman: Because we were a genetic database. We were supporting research and we had DNA from subjects and we also had phenotype data. Most of the phenotype data was how they responded to drugs.\\n\\n10\\n00:01:35.070 --&gt; 00:01:42.120\\nruss altman: As I said in the last module is about 10 million locations in the genome. And one of the calculations we did and we published this\\n\\n11\\n00:01:42.780 --&gt; 00:01:52.230\\nruss altman: Was that even though there are 10 million locations you only need 60 to 100 of these snips. Remember the snips, the single base pair switches\\n\\n12\\n00:01:52.680 --&gt; 00:02:03.480\\nruss altman: If you tell me 100 positions in your genome and which letter you have that&#x27;s enough typically for you to be unique, other than a\\n\\n13\\n00:02:04.470 --&gt; 00:02:16.380\\nruss altman: Other than a a identical twin. So that was a wake up call for everybody because it was like, wow, you don&#x27;t need a very big piece of DNA to make it like a fingerprint now.\\n\\n14\\n00:02:16.830 --&gt; 00:02:26.520\\nruss altman: The thing is just because you have the DNA and you sequence it and you know those hundred measurements that doesn&#x27;t tell you who the person is unless there&#x27;s another database.\\n\\n15\\n00:02:26.880 --&gt; 00:02:33.630\\nruss altman: That has either the person&#x27;s identification and their DNA. So you could match up the DNA and figure out who the person is\\n\\n16\\n00:02:34.140 --&gt; 00:02:43.860\\nruss altman: Or if it has enough information about that person without giving you their actual name. There&#x27;s enough information for you to figure out their name like\\n\\n17\\n00:02:44.460 --&gt; 00:02:57.630\\nruss altman: All of their geo locations over the last period of time or all of their purchases on Amazon. Again, not as easy as looking up a name. But if you are motivated and if you have a lot of data, you may be able to figure out who they are.\\n\\n18\\n00:02:57.960 --&gt; 00:03:01.890\\nruss altman: And this is what this is about, particularly in the context of genetic data.\\n\\n19\\n00:03:02.700 --&gt; 00:03:13.710\\nruss altman: So as I said, if the genetic data can be associated with the phenotype data, then you might be able to figure out who&#x27;s in a study and I&#x27;ll give you some examples. So we can make it real.\\n\\n20\\n00:03:14.190 --&gt; 00:03:28.620\\nruss altman: In fact, there are examples before DNA was a thing or before it was, you know, measured routinely. There&#x27;s a couple of great cases. My favorite case is the governor of Massachusetts. Well, this was about 20 years ago.\\n\\n21\\n00:03:29.850 --&gt; 00:03:42.480\\nruss altman: He released public health records. And he said, This is great. He said, We&#x27;re going to catalyze research and public health. We&#x27;ve removed all the names and birthdays and addresses.\\n\\n22\\n00:03:43.350 --&gt; 00:03:46.500\\nruss altman: Detailed addresses so you don&#x27;t have to worry about your privacy.\\n\\n23\\n00:03:47.490 --&gt; 00:03:55.680\\nruss altman: And of course, Massachusetts is the home for Harvard Medical School and many other medical schools, and this was going to be a great thing for Massachusetts to have this great data set.\\n\\n24\\n00:03:56.100 --&gt; 00:04:08.820\\nruss altman: Well, three days after governor weld released this data, a researcher at MIT, who was a privacy expert sent governor weld medical records to the Boston Globe.\\n\\n25\\n00:04:09.840 --&gt; 00:04:11.760\\nruss altman: In a beautiful, beautiful moment.\\n\\n26\\n00:04:12.930 --&gt; 00:04:23.940\\nruss altman: And so what did they do well. It was true that the names and addresses had been removed, but they showed that they could use the voter ID roles which are public.\\n\\n27\\n00:04:24.270 --&gt; 00:04:27.090\\nruss altman: And the Department of Motor Vehicle roles which are public.\\n\\n28\\n00:04:27.390 --&gt; 00:04:40.830\\nruss altman: To figure out governor welds age his birthday, where he lives and then the one other thing they had was, they actually the Boston Globe itself had published at peace, saying that the governor had been to the doctor on a certain day\\n\\n29\\n00:04:41.070 --&gt; 00:04:57.450\\nruss altman: And had a clean bill of health. It was like a little public interest piece, but then they knew at least one day when somebody of Governor weld age and in his neighborhood went to a physician that generated a bill and with all of that and the bill was in the public health data.\\n\\n30\\n00:04:58.830 --&gt; 00:05:07.560\\nruss altman: So those data sets, they were able to combine and figure out that that was the governor. Now, could they do this for everybody. Well,\\n\\n31\\n00:05:07.800 --&gt; 00:05:25.980\\nruss altman: Not routinely because we all don&#x27;t have our visits to the doctor put into the Boston Globe, but we all do certain things on Facebook or whatever that might give somebody a clue that would allow them to re identify a data set that otherwise seemed like it might be private and de identified\\n\\n32\\n00:05:27.690 --&gt; 00:05:39.720\\nruss altman: The same researcher went on to show that there&#x27;s a problem in the medical literature with rare diseases. So they, in this case, they went to the New England Journal of Medicine, you know, one of the fanciest medical research journals.\\n\\n33\\n00:05:40.740 --&gt; 00:05:52.320\\nruss altman: And they had like the University of Chicago. I believe had done a study on a rare disease and they had included DNA sequence in in the article.\\n\\n34\\n00:05:53.490 --&gt; 00:06:06.810\\nruss altman: And it was long enough so that it had lots of these snips. Now, my colleague by the way this is Tanya Sweeney, who now. I think I don&#x27;t know where she is now. She had, she had been at MIT. She went to\\n\\n35\\n00:06:08.940 --&gt; 00:06:14.220\\nruss altman: She went to Penn and I think she might be at Harvard. I&#x27;m confused about where she is. But she&#x27;s great.\\n\\n36\\n00:06:15.810 --&gt; 00:06:24.870\\nruss altman: She figured that well let&#x27;s just look at the Chicago area probably people who go to the University of Chicago. Medical Center are in the Chicago area.\\n\\n37\\n00:06:25.080 --&gt; 00:06:33.240\\nruss altman: So, and this is a rare disease. So when she went to the public health records. There was not hundreds and hundreds of people with these diseases, there was like four\\n\\n38\\n00:06:33.630 --&gt; 00:06:45.210\\nruss altman: And then they sit the in the in the New England Journal article the the investigators had also said, oh, and this is a five year old little girl when I, you know, five year old little girl rare diagnosis.\\n\\n39\\n00:06:46.140 --&gt; 00:06:53.430\\nruss altman: Now you know some of that girls little DNA sequence know her DNA was perfectly normal size of the little girl was little.\\n\\n40\\n00:06:54.090 --&gt; 00:07:03.330\\nruss altman: But, you know, now who that patient probably was. Now, of course, my colleague didn&#x27;t do anything nefarious with its information, but she did publish\\n\\n41\\n00:07:03.720 --&gt; 00:07:13.530\\nruss altman: On the fact that there are these risks that people are taking that they might not fully realize when they provide data in such a way that it could be\\n\\n42\\n00:07:14.460 --&gt; 00:07:24.900\\nruss altman: Used to re identify subjects we always ask or we like to think that we always ask patients if we can use their data for research and we&#x27;re very grateful when they consent.\\n\\n43\\n00:07:25.830 --&gt; 00:07:38.940\\nruss altman: But part of that consent is usually a some sort of guarantee that their identity will be kept private and now there&#x27;s a real question about whether you should make a guarantee.\\n\\n44\\n00:07:39.660 --&gt; 00:07:49.920\\nruss altman: Versus just say we&#x27;re going to make best effort to keep your identity private. But these kinds of things can happen. And we would be lying if we said that we can absolutely guaranteed privacy.\\n\\n45\\n00:07:52.170 --&gt; 00:07:56.490\\nruss altman: So we wrote a paper about this, as I said, this is now super old 16 years old.\\n\\n46\\n00:07:58.380 --&gt; 00:08:06.810\\nruss altman: ardo and isn&#x27;t statistics here Jen was a graduate student and we talked about this trade off between genomic research and human subject privacy.\\n\\n47\\n00:08:07.350 --&gt; 00:08:18.960\\nruss altman: So this is the paper where we did the calculation that 60 to 100 snips are basically unique any 60 to 100 snips are basically unique for a person\\n\\n48\\n00:08:19.650 --&gt; 00:08:33.660\\nruss altman: And then we wrote it up as a Policy Forum, because although they liked our scientific finding they thought the more important message might be about what does this mean for a policy about genetic genetic privacy.\\n\\n49\\n00:08:35.190 --&gt; 00:08:47.280\\nruss altman: So here is the EU, I have to delete some of that some of that writing here is the main graph which we came up with it is extremely simple but they liked it.\\n\\n50\\n00:08:48.450 --&gt; 00:08:53.550\\nruss altman: On the x axis. It&#x27;s the number of snips that are measured\\n\\n51\\n00:08:54.960 --&gt; 00:09:02.700\\nruss altman: And on the y axis is a, I would say a qualitative metric of privacy being low, medium, and high\\n\\n52\\n00:09:03.420 --&gt; 00:09:15.150\\nruss altman: Not my most quantitative moment of my career, but what we showed is if you want high privacy. You can only release tiny, tiny amounts of your DNA for any kind of guarantee\\n\\n53\\n00:09:15.600 --&gt; 00:09:21.600\\nruss altman: And as soon as you get up to 100 snips or beyond your privacy is low.\\n\\n54\\n00:09:22.080 --&gt; 00:09:39.030\\nruss altman: But that is precisely where we are going to make discoveries. So we really want to be out here to the far right, which means we have a problem with our guarantees of privacy, which we really should not make and that was the main point of that article.\\n\\n55\\n00:09:43.650 --&gt; 00:09:58.170\\nruss altman: So then comes my one of my favorite stories. I was giving a talk like this, but I didn&#x27;t have a great example of anybody actually using genetic information to re identify and then there was this great story and the, what is that UK\\n\\n56\\n00:09:59.280 --&gt; 00:10:12.180\\nruss altman: That London based, I want to say, The Daily Mail or the or the Guardian one of those had this great story about a teenager in the UK who figured out who his sperm donor father was\\n\\n57\\n00:10:13.080 --&gt; 00:10:29.730\\nruss altman: This team was my hero. So the father donate sperm anonymously 15 years ago he gets some money and they tell him that he will be forever anonymous. The only thing they&#x27;re ever going to give out. And this was their huge mistake was they were going to give out\\n\\n58\\n00:10:31.980 --&gt; 00:10:32.580\\nruss altman: Whoops.\\n\\n59\\n00:10:34.230 --&gt; 00:10:36.150\\nruss altman: The county where he was born.\\n\\n60\\n00:10:37.380 --&gt; 00:10:47.010\\nruss altman: And the year of his birth, and he said, Okay, you know that I come from a very populated County. And there was also many people born that year. Sounds Okay.\\n\\n61\\n00:10:47.520 --&gt; 00:10:57.450\\nruss altman: All right, so a woman gets a sperm donation has a baby baby grows up to be a teenager and is interested in his heritage and also and also smart.\\n\\n62\\n00:11:01.170 --&gt; 00:11:07.650\\nruss altman: There is a company that will use a commercial kid to look at your just your Y chromosome.\\n\\n63\\n00:11:09.150 --&gt; 00:11:19.560\\nruss altman: To tell you which version of the Y chromosome. You have now I will remind you that you get your Y chromosome from your biological father\\n\\n64\\n00:11:20.100 --&gt; 00:11:34.350\\nruss altman: And the kid knew this. So he said, Okay, I&#x27;m gonna find out about my Y chromosome that doesn&#x27;t tell you who your father is you know there&#x27;s 30 or 40 or 50 Y chromosome types, but obviously there&#x27;s a lot of people. However, this website.\\n\\n65\\n00:11:35.520 --&gt; 00:11:47.370\\nruss altman: This company had a website where if you gave up your last name, it would tell you other men who had the same pattern or variation in their Y chromosome. Now, you\\n\\n66\\n00:11:48.600 --&gt; 00:11:57.600\\nruss altman: The other thing you get from your dad in a petrol lineal society is their last name, which is which is what the UK is and was for the most part.\\n\\n67\\n00:11:58.320 --&gt; 00:12:07.170\\nruss altman: So this young man figured out that even if his biological father had not done this Y chromosome analysis.\\n\\n68\\n00:12:07.440 --&gt; 00:12:15.630\\nruss altman: There might be other people from that same family tree with the same Y chromosome, who would share the same last name.\\n\\n69\\n00:12:15.990 --&gt; 00:12:22.980\\nruss altman: So the kid got on the website gave his last name, which was irrelevant. It was whatever his mother&#x27;s or his adoptive father&#x27;s name was\\n\\n70\\n00:12:23.550 --&gt; 00:12:44.880\\nruss altman: But what he found out was all the names associated with that Y chromosome, and he could take the most common one and figure out, ah, this last name that that I&#x27;m seeing most commonly with this Y chromosome is probably my biological father&#x27;s last name. Oh, did we freeze.\\n\\n71\\n00:12:46.800 --&gt; 00:12:53.070\\nruss altman: I think we froze. So I&#x27;m going to stop here and restart because I don&#x27;t want to redo this part of the lecture.\\n\\n72\\n00:12:54.510 --&gt; 00:12:58.380\\nruss altman: But he figured out his last name.\\n\\n73\\n00:12:59.460 --&gt; 00:13:07.680\\nruss altman: Now he knew the county, the year M. The last name. He looked in the phone book he found two people with the same pattern.\\n\\n74\\n00:13:07.980 --&gt; 00:13:16.410\\nruss altman: He called one of them and said, Are you my father. And the guy said, I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about, and hung up, and he called the other one instead. Are you my father, and there was a long pause.\\n\\n75\\n00:13:16.920 --&gt; 00:13:24.510\\nruss altman: Bingo. You found your father, so he can find the he can find the information about age region of birth and year\\n\\n76\\n00:13:25.050 --&gt; 00:13:35.790\\nruss altman: To contact his father, so he really identified this guy who 15 YEARS AGO. GAVE sperm and thought he would never hear about it again, great example. And I&#x27;ll be back with the rest of the module.\\n\\n&quot;, &#x27;GMT20200407-010344_BioE-131-M.transcript.txt&#x27;: &quot;WEBVTT\\n\\n1\\n00:00:02.429 --&gt; 00:00:04.859\\nruss altman: Welcome to Module 11 hello, David.\\n\\n2\\n00:00:05.370 --&gt; 00:00:06.089\\nA Ross.\\n\\n3\\n00:00:07.500 --&gt; 00:00:08.099\\nDavid Magnus: Ready.\\n\\n4\\n00:00:08.610 --&gt; 00:00:13.290\\nDavid Magnus: Away. Today we&#x27;re gonna be talking about the uses of blood spots in research.\\n\\n5\\n00:00:15.120 --&gt; 00:00:27.300\\nDavid Magnus: So California law currently allows a theoretically parents to opt out, but almost none of them know that they can opt out of the uses for research. So in practice they don&#x27;t really have any option.\\n\\n6\\n00:00:28.350 --&gt; 00:00:38.460\\nDavid Magnus: There are people who make a lot of arguments, both in favor and against obtaining consent from people for allowing their uses and research and we&#x27;re going to just summarize some of those arguments.\\n\\n7\\n00:00:40.080 --&gt; 00:00:48.480\\nDavid Magnus: So first of all, there are some regulatory arguments against using a blood spots without consent first\\n\\n8\\n00:00:49.140 --&gt; 00:00:59.130\\nDavid Magnus: How is it even possible to use tissue from somebody without their consent. Well, the law allows the use of of material.\\n\\n9\\n00:00:59.790 --&gt; 00:01:08.580\\nDavid Magnus: As long as it&#x27;s de identified. So as long as the researchers don&#x27;t know who it&#x27;s from. Then under the current regulations that require that we get\\n\\n10\\n00:01:09.300 --&gt; 00:01:21.600\\nDavid Magnus: Informed consent for research, which we talked about earlier in the course, those regulations don&#x27;t apply because unless it&#x27;s identifiable. It doesn&#x27;t count as human subjects research.\\n\\n11\\n00:01:22.920 --&gt; 00:01:28.770\\nDavid Magnus: However, for this and this has really been the basis of why a lot of this blood spot. Research has taken place.\\n\\n12\\n00:01:29.010 --&gt; 00:01:37.890\\nDavid Magnus: However, and we&#x27;re going to be talking about this issue of re identification in much more detail in a future class, but the idea that you could have data.\\n\\n13\\n00:01:38.220 --&gt; 00:01:53.130\\nDavid Magnus: And especially genomic data and claim that it&#x27;s the identified has become increasingly problematic. And what that means is that the loophole in a way that people have been using to justify research without consent.\\n\\n14\\n00:01:54.630 --&gt; 00:01:56.730\\nDavid Magnus: Is getting harder and harder to maintain\\n\\n15\\n00:01:57.810 --&gt; 00:01:59.970\\nDavid Magnus: And some of the new regulations governing\\n\\n16\\n00:02:01.080 --&gt; 00:02:09.720\\nDavid Magnus: Research with blood spots explicitly says we should think of these things as identifiable therefore that loophole goes away.\\n\\n17\\n00:02:10.620 --&gt; 00:02:19.140\\nDavid Magnus: In addition to this regulatory argument. There&#x27;s also an ethical argument against using samples for research without consent.\\n\\n18\\n00:02:20.130 --&gt; 00:02:34.650\\nDavid Magnus: A lot of bioethicists have have done studies and surveys and they show that most of the public wants to be asked for permission before their samples are used. In fact, the people behind the campaigns in Minnesota.\\n\\n19\\n00:02:34.980 --&gt; 00:02:40.890\\nDavid Magnus: And in Texas that led to the destruction of their blood spots what the leaders all said was\\n\\n20\\n00:02:41.160 --&gt; 00:02:53.520\\nDavid Magnus: I would have consented, and let you use my blood spots, but doing it without buying permission is just wrong, and therefore I we bought these blood spot should be thrown out and you shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to do this unless you ask for permission first.\\n\\n21\\n00:02:55.860 --&gt; 00:02:58.650\\nDavid Magnus: privacy rights regarding control of this information.\\n\\n22\\n00:02:59.670 --&gt; 00:03:05.220\\nDavid Magnus: suggests a violation. So that&#x27;s the ontological concern that this is a violation of them as individuals.\\n\\n23\\n00:03:05.610 --&gt; 00:03:20.730\\nDavid Magnus: Moreover, it&#x27;s really important that the public have trust in the research community and we know that consent can play an important role in that process, a group of researchers led by Jeff Bob can have done a study of\\n\\n24\\n00:03:22.080 --&gt; 00:03:30.270\\nDavid Magnus: Of thinking about how what the best approach to this is when they looked at all the empirical studies of public attitudes parental attitudes.\\n\\n25\\n00:03:30.510 --&gt; 00:03:36.720\\nDavid Magnus: When they look at all the guideline statements from professional bodies as well as actual state policies.\\n\\n26\\n00:03:37.320 --&gt; 00:03:48.810\\nDavid Magnus: They use that as a basis for an expert working group and the result was that they made some recommendations, though most people when you ask them prefer opt in consent, where you actually say Can I have permission.\\n\\n27\\n00:03:49.590 --&gt; 00:03:57.030\\nDavid Magnus: The group concluded that opt out consent was justifiable, that is, you would still ask for permission but the default\\n\\n28\\n00:03:57.930 --&gt; 00:04:09.000\\nDavid Magnus: Would be that they would that they were presumed to be in the research, unless they explicitly said, I don&#x27;t want to be a part of it. And this creates a little bit of a nudge using trace art, architecture in favor of it.\\n\\n29\\n00:04:09.540 --&gt; 00:04:15.060\\nruss altman: Just compose there. I believe there&#x27;s a ton of data that you get very different\\n\\n30\\n00:04:15.750 --&gt; 00:04:26.940\\nruss altman: numbers of people signing up in opt in versus opt out. So even though, in theory, saying opt in or opt out should lead to the same number, depending if you&#x27;re making your decisions solely on your preferences.\\n\\n31\\n00:04:27.480 --&gt; 00:04:36.360\\nruss altman: There&#x27;s a literature that shows that when you opt in, you get if it&#x27;s automatic opt in, you get way less people than if you automatically opt them out.\\n\\n32\\n00:04:36.870 --&gt; 00:04:46.980\\nDavid Magnus: That&#x27;s correct. That&#x27;s really why choice architecture and and preset preferences really work to have a different have an impact on on on people&#x27;s behavior.\\n\\n33\\n00:04:48.120 --&gt; 00:04:55.350\\nDavid Magnus: But, of course, the more robust that the opt out consent is, the more it gets like opt in.\\n\\n34\\n00:04:55.620 --&gt; 00:04:57.360\\nDavid Magnus: Then the less that impact has\\n\\n35\\n00:04:58.860 --&gt; 00:05:02.760\\nDavid Magnus: So, and, and one of the things that some of the researchers found is\\n\\n36\\n00:05:03.000 --&gt; 00:05:10.170\\nDavid Magnus: People who said, I think I should opt in. When explained why they didn&#x27;t think that was a good idea because you wouldn&#x27;t have robust enough numbers.\\n\\n37\\n00:05:10.380 --&gt; 00:05:23.340\\nDavid Magnus: The data wouldn&#x27;t be as useful. And what if we did a really robust opt out. Most people come around to saying opt out would be okay. And so that&#x27;s more or less the majority view in the bioethics community.\\n\\n38\\n00:05:23.820 --&gt; 00:05:30.060\\nDavid Magnus: But there are some important arguments in favor of using even unscented blood spots and maybe not requiring consent.\\n\\n39\\n00:05:31.410 --&gt; 00:05:39.240\\nDavid Magnus: Obviously, currently, it doesn&#x27;t count as human subjects under the regulations. If it&#x27;s the identified, but we&#x27;ve already seen that that may be problematic.\\n\\n40\\n00:05:40.380 --&gt; 00:05:49.830\\nDavid Magnus: But what some other arguments in favor include the fact that to some extent there, whether you consent or not. There has to be some research like activities.\\n\\n41\\n00:05:50.160 --&gt; 00:05:57.540\\nDavid Magnus: With blood spots, whether there&#x27;s consent or not. And that&#x27;s because even be to be able to order to use them for clinical purposes.\\n\\n42\\n00:05:57.810 --&gt; 00:06:06.570\\nDavid Magnus: You have to have quality assurance and quality improvement activities that take place on a regular basis to make sure that the test really work the way you think they do.\\n\\n43\\n00:06:06.870 --&gt; 00:06:17.820\\nDavid Magnus: And you, there is no way of opting out of that. So a very research like activity has to take place anyway, even without research and that QA QA work is\\n\\n44\\n00:06:18.510 --&gt; 00:06:28.110\\nDavid Magnus: Is outside of the regulatory system and so is allowed to be done. Moreover, the one of the worries that a lot of people have about creating even an opt out.\\n\\n45\\n00:06:28.830 --&gt; 00:06:41.760\\nDavid Magnus: consent process is that you will have less people in the databases and that that will lead to both less data less robust data and, especially, there&#x27;s a concern that that data may become\\n\\n46\\n00:06:42.180 --&gt; 00:06:53.610\\nDavid Magnus: wider and more educated and more middle class, middle class to athletes, because in general when you require consent even opt out consent, you wind up getting\\n\\n47\\n00:06:54.060 --&gt; 00:07:05.340\\nDavid Magnus: More people who are white signing up for research and you end up having less ethnic and racial minorities in groups that are underrepresented in research traditionally be included.\\n\\n48\\n00:07:06.630 --&gt; 00:07:08.700\\nDavid Magnus: Our colleague Carlos Bustamante\\n\\n49\\n00:07:09.780 --&gt; 00:07:11.130\\nDavid Magnus: This was must have been about\\n\\n50\\n00:07:12.210 --&gt; 00:07:21.780\\nDavid Magnus: Something like around eight or 10 years ago looked at genome wide association studies and at that time they were almost all done on people of European descent.\\n\\n51\\n00:07:22.110 --&gt; 00:07:28.020\\nDavid Magnus: A few years later, it got a little bit better in the US, but it was still about 96% or 94%\\n\\n52\\n00:07:28.890 --&gt; 00:07:37.230\\nDavid Magnus: From people of European descent in the research in the US and up until I would say, up until now there&#x27;s efforts to try to improve that with things like the\\n\\n53\\n00:07:37.530 --&gt; 00:07:53.940\\nDavid Magnus: All of us research program, but the truth is that most research repositories remain mostly middle class educated white people, which we know already know a lot about. And when you increase the consent requirements you make the the data more biased.\\n\\n54\\n00:07:54.330 --&gt; 00:08:00.480\\nruss altman: And saying if those underrepresented groups don&#x27;t trust the Healthcare Research Establishment\\n\\n55\\n00:08:01.620 --&gt; 00:08:06.090\\nruss altman: Is it really the right thing to do, to say, well, we&#x27;re going to take that choice away from you.\\n\\n56\\n00:08:06.390 --&gt; 00:08:10.500\\nDavid Magnus: So that&#x27;s a really great question. And that really relates to the question of really\\n\\n57\\n00:08:11.100 --&gt; 00:08:16.920\\nDavid Magnus: What establishes trust. And so the people who want to defend the unconsidered blood spots.\\n\\n58\\n00:08:17.220 --&gt; 00:08:26.460\\nDavid Magnus: Are skeptical that informed consent forms and a few lines and informed consent form that people barely read and sign or refuse to sign\\n\\n59\\n00:08:26.760 --&gt; 00:08:36.720\\nDavid Magnus: Really is a very powerful way of demonstrating respect for the research participants and that will we need to do is keep these people included in the research.\\n\\n60\\n00:08:36.960 --&gt; 00:08:50.160\\nDavid Magnus: Because unconsidered blood spots are the most diverse databases that we have for lunch genomic point of view, but to actually find other more meaningful ways of demonstrating respect for those populations.\\n\\n61\\n00:08:50.790 --&gt; 00:09:00.990\\nDavid Magnus: Rather than relying on a few lot you know a few maybe even just a few paragraphs of an informed consent form that&#x27;s probably not understand unless they&#x27;re their lawyers.\\n\\n62\\n00:09:01.920 --&gt; 00:09:08.970\\nDavid Magnus: There&#x27;s no evidence that anybody has ever been harmed. As a result of a stored sample for decades. So the risk is low.\\n\\n63\\n00:09:09.420 --&gt; 00:09:15.870\\nDavid Magnus: And another thing that&#x27;s really important is that there&#x27;s evidence that people do value the research.\\n\\n64\\n00:09:16.380 --&gt; 00:09:22.020\\nDavid Magnus: That&#x27;s being done. So on the one hand, we want to respect the fact that people are saying, I want to give consent.\\n\\n65\\n00:09:22.350 --&gt; 00:09:30.000\\nDavid Magnus: But people are also saying when you give those people surveys. I want there to be a robust database of research and for this research to take place.\\n\\n66\\n00:09:30.240 --&gt; 00:09:38.820\\nDavid Magnus: The same surveys show that very clearly and what&#x27;s happened is that the bioethics community has basically said we&#x27;re going to give priority to one preference over another.\\n\\n67\\n00:09:39.120 --&gt; 00:09:46.860\\nDavid Magnus: But people don&#x27;t really ask that question, so they don&#x27;t ask the people like well you want the research to take place and you also want to give consent.\\n\\n68\\n00:09:47.070 --&gt; 00:09:53.490\\nDavid Magnus: But those two things may be incompatible, to some extent, and if they don&#x27;t fit together. Which do you think is more important.\\n\\n69\\n00:09:53.760 --&gt; 00:10:01.620\\nDavid Magnus: That turns out to be very hard to study, it&#x27;s not been studied very much but we&#x27;ve gotten some surprising answers when we&#x27;ve tried to explore some of those issues.\\n\\n70\\n00:10:01.860 --&gt; 00:10:12.510\\nDavid Magnus: In a study that we did, we found that 70% of people said they&#x27;d be willing to forgo consent or or lower the consent requirements in order for research to be possible.\\n\\n71\\n00:10:12.780 --&gt; 00:10:17.790\\nruss altman: Let me just say that my pen just ran out of ink. So we&#x27;re on our own from here on out. But keep going.\\n\\n72\\n00:10:18.060 --&gt; 00:10:33.720\\nDavid Magnus: Okay, so I&#x27;ll just say that one of the other challenges is when you ask people for consent. If it&#x27;s very specific consent about each particular research project that really becomes impossible and would make the research databases useless.\\n\\n73\\n00:10:34.740 --&gt; 00:10:35.670\\nDavid Magnus: There you go. Got it back.\\n\\n74\\n00:10:36.390 --&gt; 00:10:38.220\\nruss altman: I unplugged it and plugged it back in.\\n\\n75\\n00:10:38.520 --&gt; 00:10:49.740\\nDavid Magnus: Okay, there we go. So, so, so, so, so specific consent really would make the research unusable because you couldn&#x27;t ask. Go, go back to\\n\\n76\\n00:10:50.040 --&gt; 00:10:56.550\\nDavid Magnus: The database. Go back to, to all the blood spots and try and track everybody down for every time a researcher wanted to use this\\n\\n77\\n00:10:56.790 --&gt; 00:11:05.400\\nDavid Magnus: Which would mean that if you were going to have consent at all. It would have to be a very broad consent, which, again, if you&#x27;re thinking about this as a way of demonstrating respect telling them.\\n\\n78\\n00:11:05.760 --&gt; 00:11:13.350\\nDavid Magnus: We&#x27;re going to do use your blood spots for research. We don&#x27;t know exactly what&#x27;s going to be done with them, they&#x27;ll be some kind of genomic or genetic analysis done\\n\\n79\\n00:11:13.620 --&gt; 00:11:21.360\\nDavid Magnus: We can&#x27;t really predict what it&#x27;s going to be, it doesn&#x27;t really tell you very much. If you have broad consent and and yet.\\n\\n80\\n00:11:22.560 --&gt; 00:11:32.880\\nDavid Magnus: If you don&#x27;t, if you try to, as I said, have specific consent for every research project, then it would actually make the research absolutely impossible to take place.\\n\\n81\\n00:11:33.810 --&gt; 00:11:40.050\\nDavid Magnus: So cheer, there&#x27;s a trade off. People want to give consent. They want the research to take place and they want to reap its benefits.\\n\\n82\\n00:11:40.830 --&gt; 00:11:48.450\\nDavid Magnus: So studying this issue is really something that we need to do more of to see what people think of, but we also need to be\\n\\n83\\n00:11:49.080 --&gt; 00:11:57.990\\nDavid Magnus: Aware of what our options are for trying to have data that&#x27;s truly diverse and useful for researchers\\n\\n84\\n00:11:58.560 --&gt; 00:12:04.770\\nDavid Magnus: While also being respectful to participants. There&#x27;s one last wrinkle. I just want to mention, and that is\\n\\n85\\n00:12:05.550 --&gt; 00:12:17.400\\nDavid Magnus: So far we&#x27;ve been talking about this in the US context, but at least some other countries, and there&#x27;s always the potential in this country as well that there could be negative associations with some of this. So for example, in China.\\n\\n86\\n00:12:17.910 --&gt; 00:12:26.610\\nDavid Magnus: Police collected biometric information and samples of 19 million people who were being a press who are Muslims\\n\\n87\\n00:12:27.570 --&gt; 00:12:30.480\\nDavid Magnus: And using some of these technologies to try and figure out\\n\\n88\\n00:12:31.170 --&gt; 00:12:38.670\\nDavid Magnus: Who, who, people were from their DNA and to try and figure out facial patterns that they would expect to see what people would look like from their DNA.\\n\\n89\\n00:12:38.940 --&gt; 00:12:53.250\\nDavid Magnus: So they could identify them from seeing them in crowds and things like that. So there&#x27;s definitely the potential that this technology could be abused by the state or by other commercial entities and so we need to be aware of the fact that that that\\n\\n90\\n00:12:54.300 --&gt; 00:13:12.630\\nDavid Magnus: Doing this in a respectful manner requires that the uses of it be protected and some of the mechanisms for doing that include things like having really important and good governance and oversight of this research so that these kinds of uses. Don&#x27;t take place.\\n\\n91\\n00:13:14.100 --&gt; 00:13:15.000\\nDavid Magnus: And that&#x27;s it.\\n\\n92\\n00:13:15.870 --&gt; 00:13:23.160\\nruss altman: That was it. Thank you very much, the issues related to using blood spots for research. Sorry about the little pen.\\n\\n93\\n00:13:24.300 --&gt; 00:13:29.010\\nruss altman: Issue, but we will stop the share and we will stop the meeting. Thanks.\\n\\n&quot;}})\n",

This is the second part of module 22 which froze in my PowerPoint. So you just heard the story about the team who found his father in the UK and US became my hero as a early case of DNA re identification.\\n\\n2\\n00:00:21.390 --&gt; 00:00:37.980\\nruss altman: The next thing I want to tell you about, which is worrisome is this idea of identifying individuals for in a mixture. It had been widely assumed that if you have like 1000 people&#x27;s DNA in a mixture and this was somebody studied this because of forensics. Let&#x27;s say you have a\\n\\n3\\n00:00:39.180 --&gt; 00:00:43.140\\nruss altman: Person who&#x27;s not allowed to go to children&#x27;s parks, because they were a sex offender.\\n\\n4\\n00:00:44.490 --&gt; 00:00:56.880\\nruss altman: And you collected DNA at the park. There&#x27;s no way you would be able to figure out if that person was one of the people who had been at that park and left some of their DNA that was an assumption which turned out to be wrong, and in\\n\\n5\\n00:00:58.350 --&gt; 00:01:05.820\\nruss altman: Homer at all published a paper showing that if you have the genome, the genetics of a single individual.\\n\\n6\\n00:01:06.810 --&gt; 00:01:19.320\\nruss altman: And they don&#x27;t even need the whole genome. They just need about a million snips and you can measure a million snips for like 200 bucks 23andMe does a million snips as part of their $99 genetic\\n\\n7\\n00:01:20.430 --&gt; 00:01:36.090\\nruss altman: rundown. So if you can have a million snips for a single individual. And then you have a mixture of 1000 individuals and you want to know is my individual part of that mixture, you can determine that with extremely high confidence.\\n\\n8\\n00:01:37.140 --&gt; 00:01:41.610\\nruss altman: That was a surprise to people. And I just want to give you a sense for how where it comes from.\\n\\n9\\n00:01:44.190 --&gt; 00:01:55.260\\nruss altman: Okay I froze again and that irritates me so I&#x27;m just going to stop the share and restart the share hoping that that solves this problem apologize for this.\\n\\n10\\n00:02:01.260 --&gt; 00:02:03.750\\nruss altman: All right, let&#x27;s see if we can go to the next slide.\\n\\n11\\n00:02:13.050 --&gt; 00:02:18.510\\nruss altman: I do not want to draw that much I mostly want to get in back into my lecture, please.\\n\\n12\\n00:02:23.250 --&gt; 00:02:26.040\\nruss altman: So bush league Ross.\\n\\n13\\n00:02:27.120 --&gt; 00:02:37.830\\nruss altman: How did they do it statistics. So they have a million measurements of the invalid individual, for example, there&#x27;s an A deposition 3432\\n\\n14\\n00:02:39.570 --&gt; 00:02:45.030\\nruss altman: So let&#x27;s assume that 10% of all people in the general population have an A and 90% of a tea.\\n\\n15\\n00:02:45.750 --&gt; 00:03:09.810\\nruss altman: Now you have a million measurements of a mixture of 1000 other people have a mixture of 1000 people from that population. Okay, so let&#x27;s say that in those thousand people. There&#x27;s a 15% rate of a, an attempt at 5% rate of tea at that same position. Now our person had an A at at that position.\\n\\n16\\n00:03:11.250 --&gt; 00:03:14.340\\nruss altman: And you&#x27;re seeing slightly more A&#x27;s.\\n\\n17\\n00:03:15.690 --&gt; 00:03:20.310\\nruss altman: In the mixture than you are in the population at large.\\n\\n18\\n00:03:21.360 --&gt; 00:03:22.320\\nruss altman: Versus 10\\n\\n19\\n00:03:23.370 --&gt; 00:03:34.590\\nruss altman: So this person could have contributed that slight bit of extra a to the mixture does approve anything. Absolutely not.\\n\\n20\\n00:03:34.980 --&gt; 00:03:47.040\\nruss altman: First of all, they could not be in the mixture. Second of all, they could not be contributing to the X ray, but it increases the chance that they were in the mixture a tiny, tiny, tiny bit.\\n\\n21\\n00:03:48.270 --&gt; 00:03:54.870\\nruss altman: Now, so it&#x27;s slightly more probable that that individual is in, then they&#x27;re out\\n\\n22\\n00:03:56.340 --&gt; 00:04:03.600\\nruss altman: Now this is where your intuition loses you though because we have a million such measurements.\\n\\n23\\n00:04:04.020 --&gt; 00:04:15.030\\nruss altman: So every one of these tiny things that&#x27;s either in favor or against the hypothesis that they&#x27;re in the mixture adds up. And it turns out that somewhere around\\n\\n24\\n00:04:15.900 --&gt; 00:04:27.330\\nruss altman: 200 300,000 of these measurements you are positive that that person is either in or out. And then the other 700,000 just serve to increase your certainty.\\n\\n25\\n00:04:28.770 --&gt; 00:04:40.770\\nruss altman: So that&#x27;s a that&#x27;s amazing and true and it showed that people&#x27;s intuitions about went about when DNA is safe in a mixture were wrong.\\n\\n26\\n00:04:41.190 --&gt; 00:04:44.430\\nruss altman: This cause shock waves throughout the National Institutes of Health.\\n\\n27\\n00:04:44.700 --&gt; 00:04:58.080\\nruss altman: Because they had databases, where they said, here is the summary data for 1000 people, they would say 15% 85% t and they thought they were fine. And they didn&#x27;t have to worry about anybody in that study being identified\\n\\n28\\n00:04:58.410 --&gt; 00:05:06.870\\nruss altman: But if you had the genome of one of those 1000 people you could run it through the NIH database. And you could figure out if that person.\\n\\n29\\n00:05:07.230 --&gt; 00:05:09.000\\nruss altman: Participated in a study or not.\\n\\n30\\n00:05:09.390 --&gt; 00:05:21.420\\nruss altman: Why would we care about this. Well, let&#x27;s say the person signed up for a study with a sensitive diagnosis. They were sensitive about the disease that they had, they didn&#x27;t really want the rest of the world to know or their ensures or their employers.\\n\\n31\\n00:05:21.660 --&gt; 00:05:27.930\\nruss altman: And now there&#x27;s a way for somebody to figure out if they&#x27;re part of that mixture and therefore if they might have that disease.\\n\\n32\\n00:05:30.030 --&gt; 00:05:41.940\\nruss altman: This became clear and there was a New York Times article in 2013 where they showed that people could use genetics, plus the state and their age to re identify people\\n\\n33\\n00:05:42.930 --&gt; 00:05:47.700\\nruss altman: And these kinds of articles now are routinely appearing in the New York Times, showing that\\n\\n34\\n00:05:48.180 --&gt; 00:06:10.800\\nruss altman: People&#x27;s assumptions about their privacy with respect to their DNA are in many cases wrong and we really as a society need to discuss what should be the rules. So I just want to leave you with this. I should have mentioned this before I want to tell you about a law. It&#x27;s called the genetic\\n\\n35\\n00:06:13.170 --&gt; 00:06:14.370\\nruss altman: Information\\n\\n36\\n00:06:17.760 --&gt; 00:06:21.780\\nruss altman: Non discrimination act on this.\\n\\n37\\n00:06:23.130 --&gt; 00:06:24.780\\nruss altman: Whoa, let&#x27;s, let&#x27;s, a\\n\\n38\\n00:06:28.170 --&gt; 00:06:31.050\\nruss altman: Non discrimination.\\n\\n39\\n00:06:32.490 --&gt; 00:06:34.320\\nruss altman: Act or Gina\\n\\n40\\n00:06:36.750 --&gt; 00:06:44.250\\nruss altman: Gina was passed to say that you cannot discriminate against people based on their genetic data because the genetic data.\\n\\n41\\n00:06:44.610 --&gt; 00:06:57.240\\nruss altman: Often is manipulating probabilities, but it&#x27;s not giving anything that&#x27;s definite, even if it is definite though it&#x27;s not clear that you should hold it against people in employment or other forms of\\n\\n42\\n00:06:59.190 --&gt; 00:07:07.950\\nruss altman: Of financial transactions Gina is a pretty good act, but it&#x27;s limited because it does not cover disability insurance.\\n\\n43\\n00:07:11.070 --&gt; 00:07:21.750\\nruss altman: And it does not cover life insurance so they can still they being the insurance companies can still discriminate you when they&#x27;re making decisions about life insurance or disability insurance.\\n\\n44\\n00:07:22.110 --&gt; 00:07:26.040\\nruss altman: But they can&#x27;t use it for health insurance. And so that&#x27;s a big one.\\n\\n45\\n00:07:26.730 --&gt; 00:07:32.790\\nruss altman: Because now pre existing genetic information can be used to raise your rates or deny health insurance.\\n\\n46\\n00:07:33.120 --&gt; 00:07:49.980\\nruss altman: So, Gina is imperfect, but it&#x27;s a step in the right direction. Many people think most people believe that we should get rid of these exceptions and maybe we&#x27;ll talk about it in class. Okay, that&#x27;s the end of this second half of module 22\\n\\n&quot;, &#x27;GMT20200420-171758_BioE-131-M.transcript.txt&#x27;: &quot;WEBVTT\\n\\n1\\n00:00:03.179 --&gt; 00:00:08.400\\nruss altman: A bio 131. This is Russ in module 22\\n\\n2\\n00:00:09.719 --&gt; 00:00:22.200\\nruss altman: Now this is not a tech briefing module, but this is Russ, so you&#x27;re not going to get the kind of deep ethical analysis that David usually gives but hopefully we will get you close to ethics.\\n\\n3\\n00:00:22.980 --&gt; 00:00:35.760\\nruss altman: So that we can have a good discussion in class. And so you can think about these things. So this is not being labeled a technical briefing module, but you&#x27;ll see that it has more of the flavor of technical stuff and less of the ethics stuff. So whatever\\n\\n4\\n00:00:36.420 --&gt; 00:00:42.000\\nruss altman: And I hope you&#x27;re all having a good hair day you know hair is becoming an issue for all of us without any haircuts being available and so\\n\\n5\\n00:00:42.900 --&gt; 00:00:56.490\\nruss altman: A re identify ability. This is the idea that people create databases that they think are secure and which cannot have any of the individual participants be re identify\\n\\n6\\n00:00:57.360 --&gt; 00:01:07.080\\nruss altman: And cannot have any of the participants identified, but it&#x27;s false, because bottom line for this module is that\\n\\n7\\n00:01:07.620 --&gt; 00:01:16.530\\nruss altman: Sets of databases can be combined to figure out who is in a database, even if an individual database seems to be secure.\\n\\n8\\n00:01:17.490 --&gt; 00:01:23.790\\nruss altman: So in the technical briefing module. I talked about pharmacogenomics. And this database farm GK be that we&#x27;re building and we got worried\\n\\n9\\n00:01:24.120 --&gt; 00:01:34.230\\nruss altman: Because we were a genetic database. We were supporting research and we had DNA from subjects and we also had phenotype data. Most of the phenotype data was how they responded to drugs.\\n\\n10\\n00:01:35.070 --&gt; 00:01:42.120\\nruss altman: As I said in the last module is about 10 million locations in the genome. And one of the calculations we did and we published this\\n\\n11\\n00:01:42.780 --&gt; 00:01:52.230\\nruss altman: Was that even though there are 10 million locations you only need 60 to 100 of these snips. Remember the snips, the single base pair switches\\n\\n12\\n00:01:52.680 --&gt; 00:02:03.480\\nruss altman: If you tell me 100 positions in your genome and which letter you have that&#x27;s enough typically for you to be unique, other than a\\n\\n13\\n00:02:04.470 --&gt; 00:02:16.380\\nruss altman: Other than a a identical twin. So that was a wake up call for everybody because it was like, wow, you don&#x27;t need a very big piece of DNA to make it like a fingerprint now.\\n\\n14\\n00:02:16.830 --&gt; 00:02:26.520\\nruss altman: The thing is just because you have the DNA and you sequence it and you know those hundred measurements that doesn&#x27;t tell you who the person is unless there&#x27;s another database.\\n\\n15\\n00:02:26.880 --&gt; 00:02:33.630\\nruss altman: That has either the person&#x27;s identification and their DNA. So you could match up the DNA and figure out who the person is\\n\\n16\\n00:02:34.140 --&gt; 00:02:43.860\\nruss altman: Or if it has enough information about that person without giving you their actual name. There&#x27;s enough information for you to figure out their name like\\n\\n17\\n00:02:44.460 --&gt; 00:02:57.630\\nruss altman: All of their geo locations over the last period of time or all of their purchases on Amazon. Again, not as easy as looking up a name. But if you are motivated and if you have a lot of data, you may be able to figure out who they are.\\n\\n18\\n00:02:57.960 --&gt; 00:03:01.890\\nruss altman: And this is what this is about, particularly in the context of genetic data.\\n\\n19\\n00:03:02.700 --&gt; 00:03:13.710\\nruss altman: So as I said, if the genetic data can be associated with the phenotype data, then you might be able to figure out who&#x27;s in a study and I&#x27;ll give you some examples. So we can make it real.\\n\\n20\\n00:03:14.190 --&gt; 00:03:28.620\\nruss altman: In fact, there are examples before DNA was a thing or before it was, you know, measured routinely. There&#x27;s a couple of great cases. My favorite case is the governor of Massachusetts. Well, this was about 20 years ago.\\n\\n21\\n00:03:29.850 --&gt; 00:03:42.480\\nruss altman: He released public health records. And he said, This is great. He said, We&#x27;re going to catalyze research and public health. We&#x27;ve removed all the names and birthdays and addresses.\\n\\n22\\n00:03:43.350 --&gt; 00:03:46.500\\nruss altman: Detailed addresses so you don&#x27;t have to worry about your privacy.\\n\\n23\\n00:03:47.490 --&gt; 00:03:55.680\\nruss altman: And of course, Massachusetts is the home for Harvard Medical School and many other medical schools, and this was going to be a great thing for Massachusetts to have this great data set.\\n\\n24\\n00:03:56.100 --&gt; 00:04:08.820\\nruss altman: Well, three days after governor weld released this data, a researcher at MIT, who was a privacy expert sent governor weld medical records to the Boston Globe.\\n\\n25\\n00:04:09.840 --&gt; 00:04:11.760\\nruss altman: In a beautiful, beautiful moment.\\n\\n26\\n00:04:12.930 --&gt; 00:04:23.940\\nruss altman: And so what did they do well. It was true that the names and addresses had been removed, but they showed that they could use the voter ID roles which are public.\\n\\n27\\n00:04:24.270 --&gt; 00:04:27.090\\nruss altman: And the Department of Motor Vehicle roles which are public.\\n\\n28\\n00:04:27.390 --&gt; 00:04:40.830\\nruss altman: To figure out governor welds age his birthday, where he lives and then the one other thing they had was, they actually the Boston Globe itself had published at peace, saying that the governor had been to the doctor on a certain day\\n\\n29\\n00:04:41.070 --&gt; 00:04:57.450\\nruss altman: And had a clean bill of health. It was like a little public interest piece, but then they knew at least one day when somebody of Governor weld age and in his neighborhood went to a physician that generated a bill and with all of that and the bill was in the public health data.\\n\\n30\\n00:04:58.830 --&gt; 00:05:07.560\\nruss altman: So those data sets, they were able to combine and figure out that that was the governor. Now, could they do this for everybody. Well,\\n\\n31\\n00:05:07.800 --&gt; 00:05:25.980\\nruss altman: Not routinely because we all don&#x27;t have our visits to the doctor put into the Boston Globe, but we all do certain things on Facebook or whatever that might give somebody a clue that would allow them to re identify a data set that otherwise seemed like it might be private and de identified\\n\\n32\\n00:05:27.690 --&gt; 00:05:39.720\\nruss altman: The same researcher went on to show that there&#x27;s a problem in the medical literature with rare diseases. So they, in this case, they went to the New England Journal of Medicine, you know, one of the fanciest medical research journals.\\n\\n33\\n00:05:40.740 --&gt; 00:05:52.320\\nruss altman: And they had like the University of Chicago. I believe had done a study on a rare disease and they had included DNA sequence in in the article.\\n\\n34\\n00:05:53.490 --&gt; 00:06:06.810\\nruss altman: And it was long enough so that it had lots of these snips. Now, my colleague by the way this is Tanya Sweeney, who now. I think I don&#x27;t know where she is now. She had, she had been at MIT. She went to\\n\\n35\\n00:06:08.940 --&gt; 00:06:14.220\\nruss altman: She went to Penn and I think she might be at Harvard. I&#x27;m confused about where she is. But she&#x27;s great.\\n\\n36\\n00:06:15.810 --&gt; 00:06:24.870\\nruss altman: She figured that well let&#x27;s just look at the Chicago area probably people who go to the University of Chicago. Medical Center are in the Chicago area.\\n\\n37\\n00:06:25.080 --&gt; 00:06:33.240\\nruss altman: So, and this is a rare disease. So when she went to the public health records. There was not hundreds and hundreds of people with these diseases, there was like four\\n\\n38\\n00:06:33.630 --&gt; 00:06:45.210\\nruss altman: And then they sit the in the in the New England Journal article the the investigators had also said, oh, and this is a five year old little girl when I, you know, five year old little girl rare diagnosis.\\n\\n39\\n00:06:46.140 --&gt; 00:06:53.430\\nruss altman: Now you know some of that girls little DNA sequence know her DNA was perfectly normal size of the little girl was little.\\n\\n40\\n00:06:54.090 --&gt; 00:07:03.330\\nruss altman: But, you know, now who that patient probably was. Now, of course, my colleague didn&#x27;t do anything nefarious with its information, but she did publish\\n\\n41\\n00:07:03.720 --&gt; 00:07:13.530\\nruss altman: On the fact that there are these risks that people are taking that they might not fully realize when they provide data in such a way that it could be\\n\\n42\\n00:07:14.460 --&gt; 00:07:24.900\\nruss altman: Used to re identify subjects we always ask or we like to think that we always ask patients if we can use their data for research and we&#x27;re very grateful when they consent.\\n\\n43\\n00:07:25.830 --&gt; 00:07:38.940\\nruss altman: But part of that consent is usually a some sort of guarantee that their identity will be kept private and now there&#x27;s a real question about whether you should make a guarantee.\\n\\n44\\n00:07:39.660 --&gt; 00:07:49.920\\nruss altman: Versus just say we&#x27;re going to make best effort to keep your identity private. But these kinds of things can happen. And we would be lying if we said that we can absolutely guaranteed privacy.\\n\\n45\\n00:07:52.170 --&gt; 00:07:56.490\\nruss altman: So we wrote a paper about this, as I said, this is now super old 16 years old.\\n\\n46\\n00:07:58.380 --&gt; 00:08:06.810\\nruss altman: ardo and isn&#x27;t statistics here Jen was a graduate student and we talked about this trade off between genomic research and human subject privacy.\\n\\n47\\n00:08:07.350 --&gt; 00:08:18.960\\nruss altman: So this is the paper where we did the calculation that 60 to 100 snips are basically unique any 60 to 100 snips are basically unique for a person\\n\\n48\\n00:08:19.650 --&gt; 00:08:33.660\\nruss altman: And then we wrote it up as a Policy Forum, because although they liked our scientific finding they thought the more important message might be about what does this mean for a policy about genetic genetic privacy.\\n\\n49\\n00:08:35.190 --&gt; 00:08:47.280\\nruss altman: So here is the EU, I have to delete some of that some of that writing here is the main graph which we came up with it is extremely simple but they liked it.\\n\\n50\\n00:08:48.450 --&gt; 00:08:53.550\\nruss altman: On the x axis. It&#x27;s the number of snips that are measured\\n\\n51\\n00:08:54.960 --&gt; 00:09:02.700\\nruss altman: And on the y axis is a, I would say a qualitative metric of privacy being low, medium, and high\\n\\n52\\n00:09:03.420 --&gt; 00:09:15.150\\nruss altman: Not my most quantitative moment of my career, but what we showed is if you want high privacy. You can only release tiny, tiny amounts of your DNA for any kind of guarantee\\n\\n53\\n00:09:15.600 --&gt; 00:09:21.600\\nruss altman: And as soon as you get up to 100 snips or beyond your privacy is low.\\n\\n54\\n00:09:22.080 --&gt; 00:09:39.030\\nruss altman: But that is precisely where we are going to make discoveries. So we really want to be out here to the far right, which means we have a problem with our guarantees of privacy, which we really should not make and that was the main point of that article.\\n\\n55\\n00:09:43.650 --&gt; 00:09:58.170\\nruss altman: So then comes my one of my favorite stories. I was giving a talk like this, but I didn&#x27;t have a great example of anybody actually using genetic information to re identify and then there was this great story and the, what is that UK\\n\\n56\\n00:09:59.280 --&gt; 00:10:12.180\\nruss altman: That London based, I want to say, The Daily Mail or the or the Guardian one of those had this great story about a teenager in the UK who figured out who his sperm donor father was\\n\\n57\\n00:10:13.080 --&gt; 00:10:29.730\\nruss altman: This team was my hero. So the father donate sperm anonymously 15 years ago he gets some money and they tell him that he will be forever anonymous. The only thing they&#x27;re ever going to give out. And this was their huge mistake was they were going to give out\\n\\n58\\n00:10:31.980 --&gt; 00:10:32.580\\nruss altman: Whoops.\\n\\n59\\n00:10:34.230 --&gt; 00:10:36.150\\nruss altman: The county where he was born.\\n\\n60\\n00:10:37.380 --&gt; 00:10:47.010\\nruss altman: And the year of his birth, and he said, Okay, you know that I come from a very populated County. And there was also many people born that year. Sounds Okay.\\n\\n61\\n00:10:47.520 --&gt; 00:10:57.450\\nruss altman: All right, so a woman gets a sperm donation has a baby baby grows up to be a teenager and is interested in his heritage and also and also smart.\\n\\n62\\n00:11:01.170 --&gt; 00:11:07.650\\nruss altman: There is a company that will use a commercial kid to look at your just your Y chromosome.\\n\\n63\\n00:11:09.150 --&gt; 00:11:19.560\\nruss altman: To tell you which version of the Y chromosome. You have now I will remind you that you get your Y chromosome from your biological father\\n\\n64\\n00:11:20.100 --&gt; 00:11:34.350\\nruss altman: And the kid knew this. So he said, Okay, I&#x27;m gonna find out about my Y chromosome that doesn&#x27;t tell you who your father is you know there&#x27;s 30 or 40 or 50 Y chromosome types, but obviously there&#x27;s a lot of people. However, this website.\\n\\n65\\n00:11:35.520 --&gt; 00:11:47.370\\nruss altman: This company had a website where if you gave up your last name, it would tell you other men who had the same pattern or variation in their Y chromosome. Now, you\\n\\n66\\n00:11:48.600 --&gt; 00:11:57.600\\nruss altman: The other thing you get from your dad in a petrol lineal society is their last name, which is which is what the UK is and was for the most part.\\n\\n67\\n00:11:58.320 --&gt; 00:12:07.170\\nruss altman: So this young man figured out that even if his biological father had not done this Y chromosome analysis.\\n\\n68\\n00:12:07.440 --&gt; 00:12:15.630\\nruss altman: There might be other people from that same family tree with the same Y chromosome, who would share the same last name.\\n\\n69\\n00:12:15.990 --&gt; 00:12:22.980\\nruss altman: So the kid got on the website gave his last name, which was irrelevant. It was whatever his mother&#x27;s or his adoptive father&#x27;s name was\\n\\n70\\n00:12:23.550 --&gt; 00:12:44.880\\nruss altman: But what he found out was all the names associated with that Y chromosome, and he could take the most common one and figure out, ah, this last name that that I&#x27;m seeing most commonly with this Y chromosome is probably my biological father&#x27;s last name. Oh, did we freeze.\\n\\n71\\n00:12:46.800 --&gt; 00:12:53.070\\nruss altman: I think we froze. So I&#x27;m going to stop here and restart because I don&#x27;t want to redo this part of the lecture.\\n\\n72\\n00:12:54.510 --&gt; 00:12:58.380\\nruss altman: But he figured out his last name.\\n\\n73\\n00:12:59.460 --&gt; 00:13:07.680\\nruss altman: Now he knew the county, the year M. The last name. He looked in the phone book he found two people with the same pattern.\\n\\n74\\n00:13:07.980 --&gt; 00:13:16.410\\nruss altman: He called one of them and said, Are you my father. And the guy said, I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about, and hung up, and he called the other one instead. Are you my father, and there was a long pause.\\n\\n75\\n00:13:16.920 --&gt; 00:13:24.510\\nruss altman: Bingo. You found your father, so he can find the he can find the information about age region of birth and year\\n\\n76\\n00:13:25.050 --&gt; 00:13:35.790\\nruss altman: To contact his father, so he really identified this guy who 15 YEARS AGO. GAVE sperm and thought he would never hear about it again, great example. And I&#x27;ll be back with the rest of the module.\\n\\n&quot;, &#x27;GMT20200407-010344_BioE-131-M.transcript.txt&#x27;: &quot;WEBVTT\\n\\n1\\n00:00:02.429 --&gt; 00:00:04.859\\nruss altman: Welcome to Module 11 hello, David.\\n\\n2\\n00:00:05.370 --&gt; 00:00:06.089\\nA Ross.\\n\\n3\\n00:00:07.500 --&gt; 00:00:08.099\\nDavid Magnus: Ready.\\n\\n4\\n00:00:08.610 --&gt; 00:00:13.290\\nDavid Magnus: Away. Today we&#x27;re gonna be talking about the uses of blood spots in research.\\n\\n5\\n00:00:15.120 --&gt; 00:00:27.300\\nDavid Magnus: So California law currently allows a theoretically parents to opt out, but almost none of them know that they can opt out of the uses for research. So in practice they don&#x27;t really have any option.\\n\\n6\\n00:00:28.350 --&gt; 00:00:38.460\\nDavid Magnus: There are people who make a lot of arguments, both in favor and against obtaining consent from people for allowing their uses and research and we&#x27;re going to just summarize some of those arguments.\\n\\n7\\n00:00:40.080 --&gt; 00:00:48.480\\nDavid Magnus: So first of all, there are some regulatory arguments against using a blood spots without consent first\\n\\n8\\n00:00:49.140 --&gt; 00:00:59.130\\nDavid Magnus: How is it even possible to use tissue from somebody without their consent. Well, the law allows the use of of material.\\n\\n9\\n00:00:59.790 --&gt; 00:01:08.580\\nDavid Magnus: As long as it&#x27;s de identified. So as long as the researchers don&#x27;t know who it&#x27;s from. Then under the current regulations that require that we get\\n\\n10\\n00:01:09.300 --&gt; 00:01:21.600\\nDavid Magnus: Informed consent for research, which we talked about earlier in the course, those regulations don&#x27;t apply because unless it&#x27;s identifiable. It doesn&#x27;t count as human subjects research.\\n\\n11\\n00:01:22.920 --&gt; 00:01:28.770\\nDavid Magnus: However, for this and this has really been the basis of why a lot of this blood spot. Research has taken place.\\n\\n12\\n00:01:29.010 --&gt; 00:01:37.890\\nDavid Magnus: However, and we&#x27;re going to be talking about this issue of re identification in much more detail in a future class, but the idea that you could have data.\\n\\n13\\n00:01:38.220 --&gt; 00:01:53.130\\nDavid Magnus: And especially genomic data and claim that it&#x27;s the identified has become increasingly problematic. And what that means is that the loophole in a way that people have been using to justify research without consent.\\n\\n14\\n00:01:54.630 --&gt; 00:01:56.730\\nDavid Magnus: Is getting harder and harder to maintain\\n\\n15\\n00:01:57.810 --&gt; 00:01:59.970\\nDavid Magnus: And some of the new regulations governing\\n\\n16\\n00:02:01.080 --&gt; 00:02:09.720\\nDavid Magnus: Research with blood spots explicitly says we should think of these things as identifiable therefore that loophole goes away.\\n\\n17\\n00:02:10.620 --&gt; 00:02:19.140\\nDavid Magnus: In addition to this regulatory argument. There&#x27;s also an ethical argument against using samples for research without consent.\\n\\n18\\n00:02:20.130 --&gt; 00:02:34.650\\nDavid Magnus: A lot of bioethicists have have done studies and surveys and they show that most of the public wants to be asked for permission before their samples are used. In fact, the people behind the campaigns in Minnesota.\\n\\n19\\n00:02:34.980 --&gt; 00:02:40.890\\nDavid Magnus: And in Texas that led to the destruction of their blood spots what the leaders all said was\\n\\n20\\n00:02:41.160 --&gt; 00:02:53.520\\nDavid Magnus: I would have consented, and let you use my blood spots, but doing it without buying permission is just wrong, and therefore I we bought these blood spot should be thrown out and you shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to do this unless you ask for permission first.\\n\\n21\\n00:02:55.860 --&gt; 00:02:58.650\\nDavid Magnus: privacy rights regarding control of this information.\\n\\n22\\n00:02:59.670 --&gt; 00:03:05.220\\nDavid Magnus: suggests a violation. So that&#x27;s the ontological concern that this is a violation of them as individuals.\\n\\n23\\n00:03:05.610 --&gt; 00:03:20.730\\nDavid Magnus: Moreover, it&#x27;s really important that the public have trust in the research community and we know that consent can play an important role in that process, a group of researchers led by Jeff Bob can have done a study of\\n\\n24\\n00:03:22.080 --&gt; 00:03:30.270\\nDavid Magnus: Of thinking about how what the best approach to this is when they looked at all the empirical studies of public attitudes parental attitudes.\\n\\n25\\n00:03:30.510 --&gt; 00:03:36.720\\nDavid Magnus: When they look at all the guideline statements from professional bodies as well as actual state policies.\\n\\n26\\n00:03:37.320 --&gt; 00:03:48.810\\nDavid Magnus: They use that as a basis for an expert working group and the result was that they made some recommendations, though most people when you ask them prefer opt in consent, where you actually say Can I have permission.\\n\\n27\\n00:03:49.590 --&gt; 00:03:57.030\\nDavid Magnus: The group concluded that opt out consent was justifiable, that is, you would still ask for permission but the default\\n\\n28\\n00:03:57.930 --&gt; 00:04:09.000\\nDavid Magnus: Would be that they would that they were presumed to be in the research, unless they explicitly said, I don&#x27;t want to be a part of it. And this creates a little bit of a nudge using trace art, architecture in favor of it.\\n\\n29\\n00:04:09.540 --&gt; 00:04:15.060\\nruss altman: Just compose there. I believe there&#x27;s a ton of data that you get very different\\n\\n30\\n00:04:15.750 --&gt; 00:04:26.940\\nruss altman: numbers of people signing up in opt in versus opt out. So even though, in theory, saying opt in or opt out should lead to the same number, depending if you&#x27;re making your decisions solely on your preferences.\\n\\n31\\n00:04:27.480 --&gt; 00:04:36.360\\nruss altman: There&#x27;s a literature that shows that when you opt in, you get if it&#x27;s automatic opt in, you get way less people than if you automatically opt them out.\\n\\n32\\n00:04:36.870 --&gt; 00:04:46.980\\nDavid Magnus: That&#x27;s correct. That&#x27;s really why choice architecture and and preset preferences really work to have a different have an impact on on on people&#x27;s behavior.\\n\\n33\\n00:04:48.120 --&gt; 00:04:55.350\\nDavid Magnus: But, of course, the more robust that the opt out consent is, the more it gets like opt in.\\n\\n34\\n00:04:55.620 --&gt; 00:04:57.360\\nDavid Magnus: Then the less that impact has\\n\\n35\\n00:04:58.860 --&gt; 00:05:02.760\\nDavid Magnus: So, and, and one of the things that some of the researchers found is\\n\\n36\\n00:05:03.000 --&gt; 00:05:10.170\\nDavid Magnus: People who said, I think I should opt in. When explained why they didn&#x27;t think that was a good idea because you wouldn&#x27;t have robust enough numbers.\\n\\n37\\n00:05:10.380 --&gt; 00:05:23.340\\nDavid Magnus: The data wouldn&#x27;t be as useful. And what if we did a really robust opt out. Most people come around to saying opt out would be okay. And so that&#x27;s more or less the majority view in the bioethics community.\\n\\n38\\n00:05:23.820 --&gt; 00:05:30.060\\nDavid Magnus: But there are some important arguments in favor of using even unscented blood spots and maybe not requiring consent.\\n\\n39\\n00:05:31.410 --&gt; 00:05:39.240\\nDavid Magnus: Obviously, currently, it doesn&#x27;t count as human subjects under the regulations. If it&#x27;s the identified, but we&#x27;ve already seen that that may be problematic.\\n\\n40\\n00:05:40.380 --&gt; 00:05:49.830\\nDavid Magnus: But what some other arguments in favor include the fact that to some extent there, whether you consent or not. There has to be some research like activities.\\n\\n41\\n00:05:50.160 --&gt; 00:05:57.540\\nDavid Magnus: With blood spots, whether there&#x27;s consent or not. And that&#x27;s because even be to be able to order to use them for clinical purposes.\\n\\n42\\n00:05:57.810 --&gt; 00:06:06.570\\nDavid Magnus: You have to have quality assurance and quality improvement activities that take place on a regular basis to make sure that the test really work the way you think they do.\\n\\n43\\n00:06:06.870 --&gt; 00:06:17.820\\nDavid Magnus: And you, there is no way of opting out of that. So a very research like activity has to take place anyway, even without research and that QA QA work is\\n\\n44\\n00:06:18.510 --&gt; 00:06:28.110\\nDavid Magnus: Is outside of the regulatory system and so is allowed to be done. Moreover, the one of the worries that a lot of people have about creating even an opt out.\\n\\n45\\n00:06:28.830 --&gt; 00:06:41.760\\nDavid Magnus: consent process is that you will have less people in the databases and that that will lead to both less data less robust data and, especially, there&#x27;s a concern that that data may become\\n\\n46\\n00:06:42.180 --&gt; 00:06:53.610\\nDavid Magnus: wider and more educated and more middle class, middle class to athletes, because in general when you require consent even opt out consent, you wind up getting\\n\\n47\\n00:06:54.060 --&gt; 00:07:05.340\\nDavid Magnus: More people who are white signing up for research and you end up having less ethnic and racial minorities in groups that are underrepresented in research traditionally be included.\\n\\n48\\n00:07:06.630 --&gt; 00:07:08.700\\nDavid Magnus: Our colleague Carlos Bustamante\\n\\n49\\n00:07:09.780 --&gt; 00:07:11.130\\nDavid Magnus: This was must have been about\\n\\n50\\n00:07:12.210 --&gt; 00:07:21.780\\nDavid Magnus: Something like around eight or 10 years ago looked at genome wide association studies and at that time they were almost all done on people of European descent.\\n\\n51\\n00:07:22.110 --&gt; 00:07:28.020\\nDavid Magnus: A few years later, it got a little bit better in the US, but it was still about 96% or 94%\\n\\n52\\n00:07:28.890 --&gt; 00:07:37.230\\nDavid Magnus: From people of European descent in the research in the US and up until I would say, up until now there&#x27;s efforts to try to improve that with things like the\\n\\n53\\n00:07:37.530 --&gt; 00:07:53.940\\nDavid Magnus: All of us research program, but the truth is that most research repositories remain mostly middle class educated white people, which we know already know a lot about. And when you increase the consent requirements you make the the data more biased.\\n\\n54\\n00:07:54.330 --&gt; 00:08:00.480\\nruss altman: And saying if those underrepresented groups don&#x27;t trust the Healthcare Research Establishment\\n\\n55\\n00:08:01.620 --&gt; 00:08:06.090\\nruss altman: Is it really the right thing to do, to say, well, we&#x27;re going to take that choice away from you.\\n\\n56\\n00:08:06.390 --&gt; 00:08:10.500\\nDavid Magnus: So that&#x27;s a really great question. And that really relates to the question of really\\n\\n57\\n00:08:11.100 --&gt; 00:08:16.920\\nDavid Magnus: What establishes trust. And so the people who want to defend the unconsidered blood spots.\\n\\n58\\n00:08:17.220 --&gt; 00:08:26.460\\nDavid Magnus: Are skeptical that informed consent forms and a few lines and informed consent form that people barely read and sign or refuse to sign\\n\\n59\\n00:08:26.760 --&gt; 00:08:36.720\\nDavid Magnus: Really is a very powerful way of demonstrating respect for the research participants and that will we need to do is keep these people included in the research.\\n\\n60\\n00:08:36.960 --&gt; 00:08:50.160\\nDavid Magnus: Because unconsidered blood spots are the most diverse databases that we have for lunch genomic point of view, but to actually find other more meaningful ways of demonstrating respect for those populations.\\n\\n61\\n00:08:50.790 --&gt; 00:09:00.990\\nDavid Magnus: Rather than relying on a few lot you know a few maybe even just a few paragraphs of an informed consent form that&#x27;s probably not understand unless they&#x27;re their lawyers.\\n\\n62\\n00:09:01.920 --&gt; 00:09:08.970\\nDavid Magnus: There&#x27;s no evidence that anybody has ever been harmed. As a result of a stored sample for decades. So the risk is low.\\n\\n63\\n00:09:09.420 --&gt; 00:09:15.870\\nDavid Magnus: And another thing that&#x27;s really important is that there&#x27;s evidence that people do value the research.\\n\\n64\\n00:09:16.380 --&gt; 00:09:22.020\\nDavid Magnus: That&#x27;s being done. So on the one hand, we want to respect the fact that people are saying, I want to give consent.\\n\\n65\\n00:09:22.350 --&gt; 00:09:30.000\\nDavid Magnus: But people are also saying when you give those people surveys. I want there to be a robust database of research and for this research to take place.\\n\\n66\\n00:09:30.240 --&gt; 00:09:38.820\\nDavid Magnus: The same surveys show that very clearly and what&#x27;s happened is that the bioethics community has basically said we&#x27;re going to give priority to one preference over another.\\n\\n67\\n00:09:39.120 --&gt; 00:09:46.860\\nDavid Magnus: But people don&#x27;t really ask that question, so they don&#x27;t ask the people like well you want the research to take place and you also want to give consent.\\n\\n68\\n00:09:47.070 --&gt; 00:09:53.490\\nDavid Magnus: But those two things may be incompatible, to some extent, and if they don&#x27;t fit together. Which do you think is more important.\\n\\n69\\n00:09:53.760 --&gt; 00:10:01.620\\nDavid Magnus: That turns out to be very hard to study, it&#x27;s not been studied very much but we&#x27;ve gotten some surprising answers when we&#x27;ve tried to explore some of those issues.\\n\\n70\\n00:10:01.860 --&gt; 00:10:12.510\\nDavid Magnus: In a study that we did, we found that 70% of people said they&#x27;d be willing to forgo consent or or lower the consent requirements in order for research to be possible.\\n\\n71\\n00:10:12.780 --&gt; 00:10:17.790\\nruss altman: Let me just say that my pen just ran out of ink. So we&#x27;re on our own from here on out. But keep going.\\n\\n72\\n00:10:18.060 --&gt; 00:10:33.720\\nDavid Magnus: Okay, so I&#x27;ll just say that one of the other challenges is when you ask people for consent. If it&#x27;s very specific consent about each particular research project that really becomes impossible and would make the research databases useless.\\n\\n73\\n00:10:34.740 --&gt; 00:10:35.670\\nDavid Magnus: There you go. Got it back.\\n\\n74\\n00:10:36.390 --&gt; 00:10:38.220\\nruss altman: I unplugged it and plugged it back in.\\n\\n75\\n00:10:38.520 --&gt; 00:10:49.740\\nDavid Magnus: Okay, there we go. So, so, so, so, so specific consent really would make the research unusable because you couldn&#x27;t ask. Go, go back to\\n\\n76\\n00:10:50.040 --&gt; 00:10:56.550\\nDavid Magnus: The database. Go back to, to all the blood spots and try and track everybody down for every time a researcher wanted to use this\\n\\n77\\n00:10:56.790 --&gt; 00:11:05.400\\nDavid Magnus: Which would mean that if you were going to have consent at all. It would have to be a very broad consent, which, again, if you&#x27;re thinking about this as a way of demonstrating respect telling them.\\n\\n78\\n00:11:05.760 --&gt; 00:11:13.350\\nDavid Magnus: We&#x27;re going to do use your blood spots for research. We don&#x27;t know exactly what&#x27;s going to be done with them, they&#x27;ll be some kind of genomic or genetic analysis done\\n\\n79\\n00:11:13.620 --&gt; 00:11:21.360\\nDavid Magnus: We can&#x27;t really predict what it&#x27;s going to be, it doesn&#x27;t really tell you very much. If you have broad consent and and yet.\\n\\n80\\n00:11:22.560 --&gt; 00:11:32.880\\nDavid Magnus: If you don&#x27;t, if you try to, as I said, have specific consent for every research project, then it would actually make the research absolutely impossible to take place.\\n\\n81\\n00:11:33.810 --&gt; 00:11:40.050\\nDavid Magnus: So cheer, there&#x27;s a trade off. People want to give consent. They want the research to take place and they want to reap its benefits.\\n\\n82\\n00:11:40.830 --&gt; 00:11:48.450\\nDavid Magnus: So studying this issue is really something that we need to do more of to see what people think of, but we also need to be\\n\\n83\\n00:11:49.080 --&gt; 00:11:57.990\\nDavid Magnus: Aware of what our options are for trying to have data that&#x27;s truly diverse and useful for researchers\\n\\n84\\n00:11:58.560 --&gt; 00:12:04.770\\nDavid Magnus: While also being respectful to participants. There&#x27;s one last wrinkle. I just want to mention, and that is\\n\\n85\\n00:12:05.550 --&gt; 00:12:17.400\\nDavid Magnus: So far we&#x27;ve been talking about this in the US context, but at least some other countries, and there&#x27;s always the potential in this country as well that there could be negative associations with some of this. So for example, in China.\\n\\n86\\n00:12:17.910 --&gt; 00:12:26.610\\nDavid Magnus: Police collected biometric information and samples of 19 million people who were being a press who are Muslims\\n\\n87\\n00:12:27.570 --&gt; 00:12:30.480\\nDavid Magnus: And using some of these technologies to try and figure out\\n\\n88\\n00:12:31.170 --&gt; 00:12:38.670\\nDavid Magnus: Who, who, people were from their DNA and to try and figure out facial patterns that they would expect to see what people would look like from their DNA.\\n\\n89\\n00:12:38.940 --&gt; 00:12:53.250\\nDavid Magnus: So they could identify them from seeing them in crowds and things like that. So there&#x27;s definitely the potential that this technology could be abused by the state or by other commercial entities and so we need to be aware of the fact that that that\\n\\n90\\n00:12:54.300 --&gt; 00:13:12.630\\nDavid Magnus: Doing this in a respectful manner requires that the uses of it be protected and some of the mechanisms for doing that include things like having really important and good governance and oversight of this research so that these kinds of uses. Don&#x27;t take place.\\n\\n91\\n00:13:14.100 --&gt; 00:13:15.000\\nDavid Magnus: And that&#x27;s it.\\n\\n92\\n00:13:15.870 --&gt; 00:13:23.160\\nruss altman: That was it. Thank you very much, the issues related to using blood spots for research. Sorry about the little pen.\\n\\n93\\n00:13:24.300 --&gt; 00:13:29.010\\nruss altman: Issue, but we will stop the share and we will stop the meeting. Thanks.\\n\\n&quot;}\n",

This is the second part of module 22 which froze in my PowerPoint. So you just heard the story about the team who found his father in the UK and US became my hero as a early case of DNA re identification.\\n\\n2\\n00:00:21.390 --&gt; 00:00:37.980\\nruss altman: The next thing I want to tell you about, which is worrisome is this idea of identifying individuals for in a mixture. It had been widely assumed that if you have like 1000 people&#x27;s DNA in a mixture and this was somebody studied this because of forensics. Let&#x27;s say you have a\\n\\n3\\n00:00:39.180 --&gt; 00:00:43.140\\nruss altman: Person who&#x27;s not allowed to go to children&#x27;s parks, because they were a sex offender.\\n\\n4\\n00:00:44.490 --&gt; 00:00:56.880\\nruss altman: And you collected DNA at the park. There&#x27;s no way you would be able to figure out if that person was one of the people who had been at that park and left some of their DNA that was an assumption which turned out to be wrong, and in\\n\\n5\\n00:00:58.350 --&gt; 00:01:05.820\\nruss altman: Homer at all published a paper showing that if you have the genome, the genetics of a single individual.\\n\\n6\\n00:01:06.810 --&gt; 00:01:19.320\\nruss altman: And they don&#x27;t even need the whole genome. They just need about a million snips and you can measure a million snips for like 200 bucks 23andMe does a million snips as part of their $99 genetic\\n\\n7\\n00:01:20.430 --&gt; 00:01:36.090\\nruss altman: rundown. So if you can have a million snips for a single individual. And then you have a mixture of 1000 individuals and you want to know is my individual part of that mixture, you can determine that with extremely high confidence.\\n\\n8\\n00:01:37.140 --&gt; 00:01:41.610\\nruss altman: That was a surprise to people. And I just want to give you a sense for how where it comes from.\\n\\n9\\n00:01:44.190 --&gt; 00:01:55.260\\nruss altman: Okay I froze again and that irritates me so I&#x27;m just going to stop the share and restart the share hoping that that solves this problem apologize for this.\\n\\n10\\n00:02:01.260 --&gt; 00:02:03.750\\nruss altman: All right, let&#x27;s see if we can go to the next slide.\\n\\n11\\n00:02:13.050 --&gt; 00:02:18.510\\nruss altman: I do not want to draw that much I mostly want to get in back into my lecture, please.\\n\\n12\\n00:02:23.250 --&gt; 00:02:26.040\\nruss altman: So bush league Ross.\\n\\n13\\n00:02:27.120 --&gt; 00:02:37.830\\nruss altman: How did they do it statistics. So they have a million measurements of the invalid individual, for example, there&#x27;s an A deposition 3432\\n\\n14\\n00:02:39.570 --&gt; 00:02:45.030\\nruss altman: So let&#x27;s assume that 10% of all people in the general population have an A and 90% of a tea.\\n\\n15\\n00:02:45.750 --&gt; 00:03:09.810\\nruss altman: Now you have a million measurements of a mixture of 1000 other people have a mixture of 1000 people from that population. Okay, so let&#x27;s say that in those thousand people. There&#x27;s a 15% rate of a, an attempt at 5% rate of tea at that same position. Now our person had an A at at that position.\\n\\n16\\n00:03:11.250 --&gt; 00:03:14.340\\nruss altman: And you&#x27;re seeing slightly more A&#x27;s.\\n\\n17\\n00:03:15.690 --&gt; 00:03:20.310\\nruss altman: In the mixture than you are in the population at large.\\n\\n18\\n00:03:21.360 --&gt; 00:03:22.320\\nruss altman: Versus 10\\n\\n19\\n00:03:23.370 --&gt; 00:03:34.590\\nruss altman: So this person could have contributed that slight bit of extra a to the mixture does approve anything. Absolutely not.\\n\\n20\\n00:03:34.980 --&gt; 00:03:47.040\\nruss altman: First of all, they could not be in the mixture. Second of all, they could not be contributing to the X ray, but it increases the chance that they were in the mixture a tiny, tiny, tiny bit.\\n\\n21\\n00:03:48.270 --&gt; 00:03:54.870\\nruss altman: Now, so it&#x27;s slightly more probable that that individual is in, then they&#x27;re out\\n\\n22\\n00:03:56.340 --&gt; 00:04:03.600\\nruss altman: Now this is where your intuition loses you though because we have a million such measurements.\\n\\n23\\n00:04:04.020 --&gt; 00:04:15.030\\nruss altman: So every one of these tiny things that&#x27;s either in favor or against the hypothesis that they&#x27;re in the mixture adds up. And it turns out that somewhere around\\n\\n24\\n00:04:15.900 --&gt; 00:04:27.330\\nruss altman: 200 300,000 of these measurements you are positive that that person is either in or out. And then the other 700,000 just serve to increase your certainty.\\n\\n25\\n00:04:28.770 --&gt; 00:04:40.770\\nruss altman: So that&#x27;s a that&#x27;s amazing and true and it showed that people&#x27;s intuitions about went about when DNA is safe in a mixture were wrong.\\n\\n26\\n00:04:41.190 --&gt; 00:04:44.430\\nruss altman: This cause shock waves throughout the National Institutes of Health.\\n\\n27\\n00:04:44.700 --&gt; 00:04:58.080\\nruss altman: Because they had databases, where they said, here is the summary data for 1000 people, they would say 15% 85% t and they thought they were fine. And they didn&#x27;t have to worry about anybody in that study being identified\\n\\n28\\n00:04:58.410 --&gt; 00:05:06.870\\nruss altman: But if you had the genome of one of those 1000 people you could run it through the NIH database. And you could figure out if that person.\\n\\n29\\n00:05:07.230 --&gt; 00:05:09.000\\nruss altman: Participated in a study or not.\\n\\n30\\n00:05:09.390 --&gt; 00:05:21.420\\nruss altman: Why would we care about this. Well, let&#x27;s say the person signed up for a study with a sensitive diagnosis. They were sensitive about the disease that they had, they didn&#x27;t really want the rest of the world to know or their ensures or their employers.\\n\\n31\\n00:05:21.660 --&gt; 00:05:27.930\\nruss altman: And now there&#x27;s a way for somebody to figure out if they&#x27;re part of that mixture and therefore if they might have that disease.\\n\\n32\\n00:05:30.030 --&gt; 00:05:41.940\\nruss altman: This became clear and there was a New York Times article in 2013 where they showed that people could use genetics, plus the state and their age to re identify people\\n\\n33\\n00:05:42.930 --&gt; 00:05:47.700\\nruss altman: And these kinds of articles now are routinely appearing in the New York Times, showing that\\n\\n34\\n00:05:48.180 --&gt; 00:06:10.800\\nruss altman: People&#x27;s assumptions about their privacy with respect to their DNA are in many cases wrong and we really as a society need to discuss what should be the rules. So I just want to leave you with this. I should have mentioned this before I want to tell you about a law. It&#x27;s called the genetic\\n\\n35\\n00:06:13.170 --&gt; 00:06:14.370\\nruss altman: Information\\n\\n36\\n00:06:17.760 --&gt; 00:06:21.780\\nruss altman: Non discrimination act on this.\\n\\n37\\n00:06:23.130 --&gt; 00:06:24.780\\nruss altman: Whoa, let&#x27;s, let&#x27;s, a\\n\\n38\\n00:06:28.170 --&gt; 00:06:31.050\\nruss altman: Non discrimination.\\n\\n39\\n00:06:32.490 --&gt; 00:06:34.320\\nruss altman: Act or Gina\\n\\n40\\n00:06:36.750 --&gt; 00:06:44.250\\nruss altman: Gina was passed to say that you cannot discriminate against people based on their genetic data because the genetic data.\\n\\n41\\n00:06:44.610 --&gt; 00:06:57.240\\nruss altman: Often is manipulating probabilities, but it&#x27;s not giving anything that&#x27;s definite, even if it is definite though it&#x27;s not clear that you should hold it against people in employment or other forms of\\n\\n42\\n00:06:59.190 --&gt; 00:07:07.950\\nruss altman: Of financial transactions Gina is a pretty good act, but it&#x27;s limited because it does not cover disability insurance.\\n\\n43\\n00:07:11.070 --&gt; 00:07:21.750\\nruss altman: And it does not cover life insurance so they can still they being the insurance companies can still discriminate you when they&#x27;re making decisions about life insurance or disability insurance.\\n\\n44\\n00:07:22.110 --&gt; 00:07:26.040\\nruss altman: But they can&#x27;t use it for health insurance. And so that&#x27;s a big one.\\n\\n45\\n00:07:26.730 --&gt; 00:07:32.790\\nruss altman: Because now pre existing genetic information can be used to raise your rates or deny health insurance.\\n\\n46\\n00:07:33.120 --&gt; 00:07:49.980\\nruss altman: So, Gina is imperfect, but it&#x27;s a step in the right direction. Many people think most people believe that we should get rid of these exceptions and maybe we&#x27;ll talk about it in class. Okay, that&#x27;s the end of this second half of module 22\\n\\n&quot;, &#x27;GMT20200420-171758_BioE-131-M.transcript.txt&#x27;: &quot;WEBVTT\\n\\n1\\n00:00:03.179 --&gt; 00:00:08.400\\nruss altman: A bio 131. This is Russ in module 22\\n\\n2\\n00:00:09.719 --&gt; 00:00:22.200\\nruss altman: Now this is not a tech briefing module, but this is Russ, so you&#x27;re not going to get the kind of deep ethical analysis that David usually gives but hopefully we will get you close to ethics.\\n\\n3\\n00:00:22.980 --&gt; 00:00:35.760\\nruss altman: So that we can have a good discussion in class. And so you can think about these things. So this is not being labeled a technical briefing module, but you&#x27;ll see that it has more of the flavor of technical stuff and less of the ethics stuff. So whatever\\n\\n4\\n00:00:36.420 --&gt; 00:00:42.000\\nruss altman: And I hope you&#x27;re all having a good hair day you know hair is becoming an issue for all of us without any haircuts being available and so\\n\\n5\\n00:00:42.900 --&gt; 00:00:56.490\\nruss altman: A re identify ability. This is the idea that people create databases that they think are secure and which cannot have any of the individual participants be re identify\\n\\n6\\n00:00:57.360 --&gt; 00:01:07.080\\nruss altman: And cannot have any of the participants identified, but it&#x27;s false, because bottom line for this module is that\\n\\n7\\n00:01:07.620 --&gt; 00:01:16.530\\nruss altman: Sets of databases can be combined to figure out who is in a database, even if an individual database seems to be secure.\\n\\n8\\n00:01:17.490 --&gt; 00:01:23.790\\nruss altman: So in the technical briefing module. I talked about pharmacogenomics. And this database farm GK be that we&#x27;re building and we got worried\\n\\n9\\n00:01:24.120 --&gt; 00:01:34.230\\nruss altman: Because we were a genetic database. We were supporting research and we had DNA from subjects and we also had phenotype data. Most of the phenotype data was how they responded to drugs.\\n\\n10\\n00:01:35.070 --&gt; 00:01:42.120\\nruss altman: As I said in the last module is about 10 million locations in the genome. And one of the calculations we did and we published this\\n\\n11\\n00:01:42.780 --&gt; 00:01:52.230\\nruss altman: Was that even though there are 10 million locations you only need 60 to 100 of these snips. Remember the snips, the single base pair switches\\n\\n12\\n00:01:52.680 --&gt; 00:02:03.480\\nruss altman: If you tell me 100 positions in your genome and which letter you have that&#x27;s enough typically for you to be unique, other than a\\n\\n13\\n00:02:04.470 --&gt; 00:02:16.380\\nruss altman: Other than a a identical twin. So that was a wake up call for everybody because it was like, wow, you don&#x27;t need a very big piece of DNA to make it like a fingerprint now.\\n\\n14\\n00:02:16.830 --&gt; 00:02:26.520\\nruss altman: The thing is just because you have the DNA and you sequence it and you know those hundred measurements that doesn&#x27;t tell you who the person is unless there&#x27;s another database.\\n\\n15\\n00:02:26.880 --&gt; 00:02:33.630\\nruss altman: That has either the person&#x27;s identification and their DNA. So you could match up the DNA and figure out who the person is\\n\\n16\\n00:02:34.140 --&gt; 00:02:43.860\\nruss altman: Or if it has enough information about that person without giving you their actual name. There&#x27;s enough information for you to figure out their name like\\n\\n17\\n00:02:44.460 --&gt; 00:02:57.630\\nruss altman: All of their geo locations over the last period of time or all of their purchases on Amazon. Again, not as easy as looking up a name. But if you are motivated and if you have a lot of data, you may be able to figure out who they are.\\n\\n18\\n00:02:57.960 --&gt; 00:03:01.890\\nruss altman: And this is what this is about, particularly in the context of genetic data.\\n\\n19\\n00:03:02.700 --&gt; 00:03:13.710\\nruss altman: So as I said, if the genetic data can be associated with the phenotype data, then you might be able to figure out who&#x27;s in a study and I&#x27;ll give you some examples. So we can make it real.\\n\\n20\\n00:03:14.190 --&gt; 00:03:28.620\\nruss altman: In fact, there are examples before DNA was a thing or before it was, you know, measured routinely. There&#x27;s a couple of great cases. My favorite case is the governor of Massachusetts. Well, this was about 20 years ago.\\n\\n21\\n00:03:29.850 --&gt; 00:03:42.480\\nruss altman: He released public health records. And he said, This is great. He said, We&#x27;re going to catalyze research and public health. We&#x27;ve removed all the names and birthdays and addresses.\\n\\n22\\n00:03:43.350 --&gt; 00:03:46.500\\nruss altman: Detailed addresses so you don&#x27;t have to worry about your privacy.\\n\\n23\\n00:03:47.490 --&gt; 00:03:55.680\\nruss altman: And of course, Massachusetts is the home for Harvard Medical School and many other medical schools, and this was going to be a great thing for Massachusetts to have this great data set.\\n\\n24\\n00:03:56.100 --&gt; 00:04:08.820\\nruss altman: Well, three days after governor weld released this data, a researcher at MIT, who was a privacy expert sent governor weld medical records to the Boston Globe.\\n\\n25\\n00:04:09.840 --&gt; 00:04:11.760\\nruss altman: In a beautiful, beautiful moment.\\n\\n26\\n00:04:12.930 --&gt; 00:04:23.940\\nruss altman: And so what did they do well. It was true that the names and addresses had been removed, but they showed that they could use the voter ID roles which are public.\\n\\n27\\n00:04:24.270 --&gt; 00:04:27.090\\nruss altman: And the Department of Motor Vehicle roles which are public.\\n\\n28\\n00:04:27.390 --&gt; 00:04:40.830\\nruss altman: To figure out governor welds age his birthday, where he lives and then the one other thing they had was, they actually the Boston Globe itself had published at peace, saying that the governor had been to the doctor on a certain day\\n\\n29\\n00:04:41.070 --&gt; 00:04:57.450\\nruss altman: And had a clean bill of health. It was like a little public interest piece, but then they knew at least one day when somebody of Governor weld age and in his neighborhood went to a physician that generated a bill and with all of that and the bill was in the public health data.\\n\\n30\\n00:04:58.830 --&gt; 00:05:07.560\\nruss altman: So those data sets, they were able to combine and figure out that that was the governor. Now, could they do this for everybody. Well,\\n\\n31\\n00:05:07.800 --&gt; 00:05:25.980\\nruss altman: Not routinely because we all don&#x27;t have our visits to the doctor put into the Boston Globe, but we all do certain things on Facebook or whatever that might give somebody a clue that would allow them to re identify a data set that otherwise seemed like it might be private and de identified\\n\\n32\\n00:05:27.690 --&gt; 00:05:39.720\\nruss altman: The same researcher went on to show that there&#x27;s a problem in the medical literature with rare diseases. So they, in this case, they went to the New England Journal of Medicine, you know, one of the fanciest medical research journals.\\n\\n33\\n00:05:40.740 --&gt; 00:05:52.320\\nruss altman: And they had like the University of Chicago. I believe had done a study on a rare disease and they had included DNA sequence in in the article.\\n\\n34\\n00:05:53.490 --&gt; 00:06:06.810\\nruss altman: And it was long enough so that it had lots of these snips. Now, my colleague by the way this is Tanya Sweeney, who now. I think I don&#x27;t know where she is now. She had, she had been at MIT. She went to\\n\\n35\\n00:06:08.940 --&gt; 00:06:14.220\\nruss altman: She went to Penn and I think she might be at Harvard. I&#x27;m confused about where she is. But she&#x27;s great.\\n\\n36\\n00:06:15.810 --&gt; 00:06:24.870\\nruss altman: She figured that well let&#x27;s just look at the Chicago area probably people who go to the University of Chicago. Medical Center are in the Chicago area.\\n\\n37\\n00:06:25.080 --&gt; 00:06:33.240\\nruss altman: So, and this is a rare disease. So when she went to the public health records. There was not hundreds and hundreds of people with these diseases, there was like four\\n\\n38\\n00:06:33.630 --&gt; 00:06:45.210\\nruss altman: And then they sit the in the in the New England Journal article the the investigators had also said, oh, and this is a five year old little girl when I, you know, five year old little girl rare diagnosis.\\n\\n39\\n00:06:46.140 --&gt; 00:06:53.430\\nruss altman: Now you know some of that girls little DNA sequence know her DNA was perfectly normal size of the little girl was little.\\n\\n40\\n00:06:54.090 --&gt; 00:07:03.330\\nruss altman: But, you know, now who that patient probably was. Now, of course, my colleague didn&#x27;t do anything nefarious with its information, but she did publish\\n\\n41\\n00:07:03.720 --&gt; 00:07:13.530\\nruss altman: On the fact that there are these risks that people are taking that they might not fully realize when they provide data in such a way that it could be\\n\\n42\\n00:07:14.460 --&gt; 00:07:24.900\\nruss altman: Used to re identify subjects we always ask or we like to think that we always ask patients if we can use their data for research and we&#x27;re very grateful when they consent.\\n\\n43\\n00:07:25.830 --&gt; 00:07:38.940\\nruss altman: But part of that consent is usually a some sort of guarantee that their identity will be kept private and now there&#x27;s a real question about whether you should make a guarantee.\\n\\n44\\n00:07:39.660 --&gt; 00:07:49.920\\nruss altman: Versus just say we&#x27;re going to make best effort to keep your identity private. But these kinds of things can happen. And we would be lying if we said that we can absolutely guaranteed privacy.\\n\\n45\\n00:07:52.170 --&gt; 00:07:56.490\\nruss altman: So we wrote a paper about this, as I said, this is now super old 16 years old.\\n\\n46\\n00:07:58.380 --&gt; 00:08:06.810\\nruss altman: ardo and isn&#x27;t statistics here Jen was a graduate student and we talked about this trade off between genomic research and human subject privacy.\\n\\n47\\n00:08:07.350 --&gt; 00:08:18.960\\nruss altman: So this is the paper where we did the calculation that 60 to 100 snips are basically unique any 60 to 100 snips are basically unique for a person\\n\\n48\\n00:08:19.650 --&gt; 00:08:33.660\\nruss altman: And then we wrote it up as a Policy Forum, because although they liked our scientific finding they thought the more important message might be about what does this mean for a policy about genetic genetic privacy.\\n\\n49\\n00:08:35.190 --&gt; 00:08:47.280\\nruss altman: So here is the EU, I have to delete some of that some of that writing here is the main graph which we came up with it is extremely simple but they liked it.\\n\\n50\\n00:08:48.450 --&gt; 00:08:53.550\\nruss altman: On the x axis. It&#x27;s the number of snips that are measured\\n\\n51\\n00:08:54.960 --&gt; 00:09:02.700\\nruss altman: And on the y axis is a, I would say a qualitative metric of privacy being low, medium, and high\\n\\n52\\n00:09:03.420 --&gt; 00:09:15.150\\nruss altman: Not my most quantitative moment of my career, but what we showed is if you want high privacy. You can only release tiny, tiny amounts of your DNA for any kind of guarantee\\n\\n53\\n00:09:15.600 --&gt; 00:09:21.600\\nruss altman: And as soon as you get up to 100 snips or beyond your privacy is low.\\n\\n54\\n00:09:22.080 --&gt; 00:09:39.030\\nruss altman: But that is precisely where we are going to make discoveries. So we really want to be out here to the far right, which means we have a problem with our guarantees of privacy, which we really should not make and that was the main point of that article.\\n\\n55\\n00:09:43.650 --&gt; 00:09:58.170\\nruss altman: So then comes my one of my favorite stories. I was giving a talk like this, but I didn&#x27;t have a great example of anybody actually using genetic information to re identify and then there was this great story and the, what is that UK\\n\\n56\\n00:09:59.280 --&gt; 00:10:12.180\\nruss altman: That London based, I want to say, The Daily Mail or the or the Guardian one of those had this great story about a teenager in the UK who figured out who his sperm donor father was\\n\\n57\\n00:10:13.080 --&gt; 00:10:29.730\\nruss altman: This team was my hero. So the father donate sperm anonymously 15 years ago he gets some money and they tell him that he will be forever anonymous. The only thing they&#x27;re ever going to give out. And this was their huge mistake was they were going to give out\\n\\n58\\n00:10:31.980 --&gt; 00:10:32.580\\nruss altman: Whoops.\\n\\n59\\n00:10:34.230 --&gt; 00:10:36.150\\nruss altman: The county where he was born.\\n\\n60\\n00:10:37.380 --&gt; 00:10:47.010\\nruss altman: And the year of his birth, and he said, Okay, you know that I come from a very populated County. And there was also many people born that year. Sounds Okay.\\n\\n61\\n00:10:47.520 --&gt; 00:10:57.450\\nruss altman: All right, so a woman gets a sperm donation has a baby baby grows up to be a teenager and is interested in his heritage and also and also smart.\\n\\n62\\n00:11:01.170 --&gt; 00:11:07.650\\nruss altman: There is a company that will use a commercial kid to look at your just your Y chromosome.\\n\\n63\\n00:11:09.150 --&gt; 00:11:19.560\\nruss altman: To tell you which version of the Y chromosome. You have now I will remind you that you get your Y chromosome from your biological father\\n\\n64\\n00:11:20.100 --&gt; 00:11:34.350\\nruss altman: And the kid knew this. So he said, Okay, I&#x27;m gonna find out about my Y chromosome that doesn&#x27;t tell you who your father is you know there&#x27;s 30 or 40 or 50 Y chromosome types, but obviously there&#x27;s a lot of people. However, this website.\\n\\n65\\n00:11:35.520 --&gt; 00:11:47.370\\nruss altman: This company had a website where if you gave up your last name, it would tell you other men who had the same pattern or variation in their Y chromosome. Now, you\\n\\n66\\n00:11:48.600 --&gt; 00:11:57.600\\nruss altman: The other thing you get from your dad in a petrol lineal society is their last name, which is which is what the UK is and was for the most part.\\n\\n67\\n00:11:58.320 --&gt; 00:12:07.170\\nruss altman: So this young man figured out that even if his biological father had not done this Y chromosome analysis.\\n\\n68\\n00:12:07.440 --&gt; 00:12:15.630\\nruss altman: There might be other people from that same family tree with the same Y chromosome, who would share the same last name.\\n\\n69\\n00:12:15.990 --&gt; 00:12:22.980\\nruss altman: So the kid got on the website gave his last name, which was irrelevant. It was whatever his mother&#x27;s or his adoptive father&#x27;s name was\\n\\n70\\n00:12:23.550 --&gt; 00:12:44.880\\nruss altman: But what he found out was all the names associated with that Y chromosome, and he could take the most common one and figure out, ah, this last name that that I&#x27;m seeing most commonly with this Y chromosome is probably my biological father&#x27;s last name. Oh, did we freeze.\\n\\n71\\n00:12:46.800 --&gt; 00:12:53.070\\nruss altman: I think we froze. So I&#x27;m going to stop here and restart because I don&#x27;t want to redo this part of the lecture.\\n\\n72\\n00:12:54.510 --&gt; 00:12:58.380\\nruss altman: But he figured out his last name.\\n\\n73\\n00:12:59.460 --&gt; 00:13:07.680\\nruss altman: Now he knew the county, the year M. The last name. He looked in the phone book he found two people with the same pattern.\\n\\n74\\n00:13:07.980 --&gt; 00:13:16.410\\nruss altman: He called one of them and said, Are you my father. And the guy said, I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about, and hung up, and he called the other one instead. Are you my father, and there was a long pause.\\n\\n75\\n00:13:16.920 --&gt; 00:13:24.510\\nruss altman: Bingo. You found your father, so he can find the he can find the information about age region of birth and year\\n\\n76\\n00:13:25.050 --&gt; 00:13:35.790\\nruss altman: To contact his father, so he really identified this guy who 15 YEARS AGO. GAVE sperm and thought he would never hear about it again, great example. And I&#x27;ll be back with the rest of the module.\\n\\n&quot;, &#x27;GMT20200407-010344_BioE-131-M.transcript.txt&#x27;: &quot;WEBVTT\\n\\n1\\n00:00:02.429 --&gt; 00:00:04.859\\nruss altman: Welcome to Module 11 hello, David.\\n\\n2\\n00:00:05.370 --&gt; 00:00:06.089\\nA Ross.\\n\\n3\\n00:00:07.500 --&gt; 00:00:08.099\\nDavid Magnus: Ready.\\n\\n4\\n00:00:08.610 --&gt; 00:00:13.290\\nDavid Magnus: Away. Today we&#x27;re gonna be talking about the uses of blood spots in research.\\n\\n5\\n00:00:15.120 --&gt; 00:00:27.300\\nDavid Magnus: So California law currently allows a theoretically parents to opt out, but almost none of them know that they can opt out of the uses for research. So in practice they don&#x27;t really have any option.\\n\\n6\\n00:00:28.350 --&gt; 00:00:38.460\\nDavid Magnus: There are people who make a lot of arguments, both in favor and against obtaining consent from people for allowing their uses and research and we&#x27;re going to just summarize some of those arguments.\\n\\n7\\n00:00:40.080 --&gt; 00:00:48.480\\nDavid Magnus: So first of all, there are some regulatory arguments against using a blood spots without consent first\\n\\n8\\n00:00:49.140 --&gt; 00:00:59.130\\nDavid Magnus: How is it even possible to use tissue from somebody without their consent. Well, the law allows the use of of material.\\n\\n9\\n00:00:59.790 --&gt; 00:01:08.580\\nDavid Magnus: As long as it&#x27;s de identified. So as long as the researchers don&#x27;t know who it&#x27;s from. Then under the current regulations that require that we get\\n\\n10\\n00:01:09.300 --&gt; 00:01:21.600\\nDavid Magnus: Informed consent for research, which we talked about earlier in the course, those regulations don&#x27;t apply because unless it&#x27;s identifiable. It doesn&#x27;t count as human subjects research.\\n\\n11\\n00:01:22.920 --&gt; 00:01:28.770\\nDavid Magnus: However, for this and this has really been the basis of why a lot of this blood spot. Research has taken place.\\n\\n12\\n00:01:29.010 --&gt; 00:01:37.890\\nDavid Magnus: However, and we&#x27;re going to be talking about this issue of re identification in much more detail in a future class, but the idea that you could have data.\\n\\n13\\n00:01:38.220 --&gt; 00:01:53.130\\nDavid Magnus: And especially genomic data and claim that it&#x27;s the identified has become increasingly problematic. And what that means is that the loophole in a way that people have been using to justify research without consent.\\n\\n14\\n00:01:54.630 --&gt; 00:01:56.730\\nDavid Magnus: Is getting harder and harder to maintain\\n\\n15\\n00:01:57.810 --&gt; 00:01:59.970\\nDavid Magnus: And some of the new regulations governing\\n\\n16\\n00:02:01.080 --&gt; 00:02:09.720\\nDavid Magnus: Research with blood spots explicitly says we should think of these things as identifiable therefore that loophole goes away.\\n\\n17\\n00:02:10.620 --&gt; 00:02:19.140\\nDavid Magnus: In addition to this regulatory argument. There&#x27;s also an ethical argument against using samples for research without consent.\\n\\n18\\n00:02:20.130 --&gt; 00:02:34.650\\nDavid Magnus: A lot of bioethicists have have done studies and surveys and they show that most of the public wants to be asked for permission before their samples are used. In fact, the people behind the campaigns in Minnesota.\\n\\n19\\n00:02:34.980 --&gt; 00:02:40.890\\nDavid Magnus: And in Texas that led to the destruction of their blood spots what the leaders all said was\\n\\n20\\n00:02:41.160 --&gt; 00:02:53.520\\nDavid Magnus: I would have consented, and let you use my blood spots, but doing it without buying permission is just wrong, and therefore I we bought these blood spot should be thrown out and you shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to do this unless you ask for permission first.\\n\\n21\\n00:02:55.860 --&gt; 00:02:58.650\\nDavid Magnus: privacy rights regarding control of this information.\\n\\n22\\n00:02:59.670 --&gt; 00:03:05.220\\nDavid Magnus: suggests a violation. So that&#x27;s the ontological concern that this is a violation of them as individuals.\\n\\n23\\n00:03:05.610 --&gt; 00:03:20.730\\nDavid Magnus: Moreover, it&#x27;s really important that the public have trust in the research community and we know that consent can play an important role in that process, a group of researchers led by Jeff Bob can have done a study of\\n\\n24\\n00:03:22.080 --&gt; 00:03:30.270\\nDavid Magnus: Of thinking about how what the best approach to this is when they looked at all the empirical studies of public attitudes parental attitudes.\\n\\n25\\n00:03:30.510 --&gt; 00:03:36.720\\nDavid Magnus: When they look at all the guideline statements from professional bodies as well as actual state policies.\\n\\n26\\n00:03:37.320 --&gt; 00:03:48.810\\nDavid Magnus: They use that as a basis for an expert working group and the result was that they made some recommendations, though most people when you ask them prefer opt in consent, where you actually say Can I have permission.\\n\\n27\\n00:03:49.590 --&gt; 00:03:57.030\\nDavid Magnus: The group concluded that opt out consent was justifiable, that is, you would still ask for permission but the default\\n\\n28\\n00:03:57.930 --&gt; 00:04:09.000\\nDavid Magnus: Would be that they would that they were presumed to be in the research, unless they explicitly said, I don&#x27;t want to be a part of it. And this creates a little bit of a nudge using trace art, architecture in favor of it.\\n\\n29\\n00:04:09.540 --&gt; 00:04:15.060\\nruss altman: Just compose there. I believe there&#x27;s a ton of data that you get very different\\n\\n30\\n00:04:15.750 --&gt; 00:04:26.940\\nruss altman: numbers of people signing up in opt in versus opt out. So even though, in theory, saying opt in or opt out should lead to the same number, depending if you&#x27;re making your decisions solely on your preferences.\\n\\n31\\n00:04:27.480 --&gt; 00:04:36.360\\nruss altman: There&#x27;s a literature that shows that when you opt in, you get if it&#x27;s automatic opt in, you get way less people than if you automatically opt them out.\\n\\n32\\n00:04:36.870 --&gt; 00:04:46.980\\nDavid Magnus: That&#x27;s correct. That&#x27;s really why choice architecture and and preset preferences really work to have a different have an impact on on on people&#x27;s behavior.\\n\\n33\\n00:04:48.120 --&gt; 00:04:55.350\\nDavid Magnus: But, of course, the more robust that the opt out consent is, the more it gets like opt in.\\n\\n34\\n00:04:55.620 --&gt; 00:04:57.360\\nDavid Magnus: Then the less that impact has\\n\\n35\\n00:04:58.860 --&gt; 00:05:02.760\\nDavid Magnus: So, and, and one of the things that some of the researchers found is\\n\\n36\\n00:05:03.000 --&gt; 00:05:10.170\\nDavid Magnus: People who said, I think I should opt in. When explained why they didn&#x27;t think that was a good idea because you wouldn&#x27;t have robust enough numbers.\\n\\n37\\n00:05:10.380 --&gt; 00:05:23.340\\nDavid Magnus: The data wouldn&#x27;t be as useful. And what if we did a really robust opt out. Most people come around to saying opt out would be okay. And so that&#x27;s more or less the majority view in the bioethics community.\\n\\n38\\n00:05:23.820 --&gt; 00:05:30.060\\nDavid Magnus: But there are some important arguments in favor of using even unscented blood spots and maybe not requiring consent.\\n\\n39\\n00:05:31.410 --&gt; 00:05:39.240\\nDavid Magnus: Obviously, currently, it doesn&#x27;t count as human subjects under the regulations. If it&#x27;s the identified, but we&#x27;ve already seen that that may be problematic.\\n\\n40\\n00:05:40.380 --&gt; 00:05:49.830\\nDavid Magnus: But what some other arguments in favor include the fact that to some extent there, whether you consent or not. There has to be some research like activities.\\n\\n41\\n00:05:50.160 --&gt; 00:05:57.540\\nDavid Magnus: With blood spots, whether there&#x27;s consent or not. And that&#x27;s because even be to be able to order to use them for clinical purposes.\\n\\n42\\n00:05:57.810 --&gt; 00:06:06.570\\nDavid Magnus: You have to have quality assurance and quality improvement activities that take place on a regular basis to make sure that the test really work the way you think they do.\\n\\n43\\n00:06:06.870 --&gt; 00:06:17.820\\nDavid Magnus: And you, there is no way of opting out of that. So a very research like activity has to take place anyway, even without research and that QA QA work is\\n\\n44\\n00:06:18.510 --&gt; 00:06:28.110\\nDavid Magnus: Is outside of the regulatory system and so is allowed to be done. Moreover, the one of the worries that a lot of people have about creating even an opt out.\\n\\n45\\n00:06:28.830 --&gt; 00:06:41.760\\nDavid Magnus: consent process is that you will have less people in the databases and that that will lead to both less data less robust data and, especially, there&#x27;s a concern that that data may become\\n\\n46\\n00:06:42.180 --&gt; 00:06:53.610\\nDavid Magnus: wider and more educated and more middle class, middle class to athletes, because in general when you require consent even opt out consent, you wind up getting\\n\\n47\\n00:06:54.060 --&gt; 00:07:05.340\\nDavid Magnus: More people who are white signing up for research and you end up having less ethnic and racial minorities in groups that are underrepresented in research traditionally be included.\\n\\n48\\n00:07:06.630 --&gt; 00:07:08.700\\nDavid Magnus: Our colleague Carlos Bustamante\\n\\n49\\n00:07:09.780 --&gt; 00:07:11.130\\nDavid Magnus: This was must have been about\\n\\n50\\n00:07:12.210 --&gt; 00:07:21.780\\nDavid Magnus: Something like around eight or 10 years ago looked at genome wide association studies and at that time they were almost all done on people of European descent.\\n\\n51\\n00:07:22.110 --&gt; 00:07:28.020\\nDavid Magnus: A few years later, it got a little bit better in the US, but it was still about 96% or 94%\\n\\n52\\n00:07:28.890 --&gt; 00:07:37.230\\nDavid Magnus: From people of European descent in the research in the US and up until I would say, up until now there&#x27;s efforts to try to improve that with things like the\\n\\n53\\n00:07:37.530 --&gt; 00:07:53.940\\nDavid Magnus: All of us research program, but the truth is that most research repositories remain mostly middle class educated white people, which we know already know a lot about. And when you increase the consent requirements you make the the data more biased.\\n\\n54\\n00:07:54.330 --&gt; 00:08:00.480\\nruss altman: And saying if those underrepresented groups don&#x27;t trust the Healthcare Research Establishment\\n\\n55\\n00:08:01.620 --&gt; 00:08:06.090\\nruss altman: Is it really the right thing to do, to say, well, we&#x27;re going to take that choice away from you.\\n\\n56\\n00:08:06.390 --&gt; 00:08:10.500\\nDavid Magnus: So that&#x27;s a really great question. And that really relates to the question of really\\n\\n57\\n00:08:11.100 --&gt; 00:08:16.920\\nDavid Magnus: What establishes trust. And so the people who want to defend the unconsidered blood spots.\\n\\n58\\n00:08:17.220 --&gt; 00:08:26.460\\nDavid Magnus: Are skeptical that informed consent forms and a few lines and informed consent form that people barely read and sign or refuse to sign\\n\\n59\\n00:08:26.760 --&gt; 00:08:36.720\\nDavid Magnus: Really is a very powerful way of demonstrating respect for the research participants and that will we need to do is keep these people included in the research.\\n\\n60\\n00:08:36.960 --&gt; 00:08:50.160\\nDavid Magnus: Because unconsidered blood spots are the most diverse databases that we have for lunch genomic point of view, but to actually find other more meaningful ways of demonstrating respect for those populations.\\n\\n61\\n00:08:50.790 --&gt; 00:09:00.990\\nDavid Magnus: Rather than relying on a few lot you know a few maybe even just a few paragraphs of an informed consent form that&#x27;s probably not understand unless they&#x27;re their lawyers.\\n\\n62\\n00:09:01.920 --&gt; 00:09:08.970\\nDavid Magnus: There&#x27;s no evidence that anybody has ever been harmed. As a result of a stored sample for decades. So the risk is low.\\n\\n63\\n00:09:09.420 --&gt; 00:09:15.870\\nDavid Magnus: And another thing that&#x27;s really important is that there&#x27;s evidence that people do value the research.\\n\\n64\\n00:09:16.380 --&gt; 00:09:22.020\\nDavid Magnus: That&#x27;s being done. So on the one hand, we want to respect the fact that people are saying, I want to give consent.\\n\\n65\\n00:09:22.350 --&gt; 00:09:30.000\\nDavid Magnus: But people are also saying when you give those people surveys. I want there to be a robust database of research and for this research to take place.\\n\\n66\\n00:09:30.240 --&gt; 00:09:38.820\\nDavid Magnus: The same surveys show that very clearly and what&#x27;s happened is that the bioethics community has basically said we&#x27;re going to give priority to one preference over another.\\n\\n67\\n00:09:39.120 --&gt; 00:09:46.860\\nDavid Magnus: But people don&#x27;t really ask that question, so they don&#x27;t ask the people like well you want the research to take place and you also want to give consent.\\n\\n68\\n00:09:47.070 --&gt; 00:09:53.490\\nDavid Magnus: But those two things may be incompatible, to some extent, and if they don&#x27;t fit together. Which do you think is more important.\\n\\n69\\n00:09:53.760 --&gt; 00:10:01.620\\nDavid Magnus: That turns out to be very hard to study, it&#x27;s not been studied very much but we&#x27;ve gotten some surprising answers when we&#x27;ve tried to explore some of those issues.\\n\\n70\\n00:10:01.860 --&gt; 00:10:12.510\\nDavid Magnus: In a study that we did, we found that 70% of people said they&#x27;d be willing to forgo consent or or lower the consent requirements in order for research to be possible.\\n\\n71\\n00:10:12.780 --&gt; 00:10:17.790\\nruss altman: Let me just say that my pen just ran out of ink. So we&#x27;re on our own from here on out. But keep going.\\n\\n72\\n00:10:18.060 --&gt; 00:10:33.720\\nDavid Magnus: Okay, so I&#x27;ll just say that one of the other challenges is when you ask people for consent. If it&#x27;s very specific consent about each particular research project that really becomes impossible and would make the research databases useless.\\n\\n73\\n00:10:34.740 --&gt; 00:10:35.670\\nDavid Magnus: There you go. Got it back.\\n\\n74\\n00:10:36.390 --&gt; 00:10:38.220\\nruss altman: I unplugged it and plugged it back in.\\n\\n75\\n00:10:38.520 --&gt; 00:10:49.740\\nDavid Magnus: Okay, there we go. So, so, so, so, so specific consent really would make the research unusable because you couldn&#x27;t ask. Go, go back to\\n\\n76\\n00:10:50.040 --&gt; 00:10:56.550\\nDavid Magnus: The database. Go back to, to all the blood spots and try and track everybody down for every time a researcher wanted to use this\\n\\n77\\n00:10:56.790 --&gt; 00:11:05.400\\nDavid Magnus: Which would mean that if you were going to have consent at all. It would have to be a very broad consent, which, again, if you&#x27;re thinking about this as a way of demonstrating respect telling them.\\n\\n78\\n00:11:05.760 --&gt; 00:11:13.350\\nDavid Magnus: We&#x27;re going to do use your blood spots for research. We don&#x27;t know exactly what&#x27;s going to be done with them, they&#x27;ll be some kind of genomic or genetic analysis done\\n\\n79\\n00:11:13.620 --&gt; 00:11:21.360\\nDavid Magnus: We can&#x27;t really predict what it&#x27;s going to be, it doesn&#x27;t really tell you very much. If you have broad consent and and yet.\\n\\n80\\n00:11:22.560 --&gt; 00:11:32.880\\nDavid Magnus: If you don&#x27;t, if you try to, as I said, have specific consent for every research project, then it would actually make the research absolutely impossible to take place.\\n\\n81\\n00:11:33.810 --&gt; 00:11:40.050\\nDavid Magnus: So cheer, there&#x27;s a trade off. People want to give consent. They want the research to take place and they want to reap its benefits.\\n\\n82\\n00:11:40.830 --&gt; 00:11:48.450\\nDavid Magnus: So studying this issue is really something that we need to do more of to see what people think of, but we also need to be\\n\\n83\\n00:11:49.080 --&gt; 00:11:57.990\\nDavid Magnus: Aware of what our options are for trying to have data that&#x27;s truly diverse and useful for researchers\\n\\n84\\n00:11:58.560 --&gt; 00:12:04.770\\nDavid Magnus: While also being respectful to participants. There&#x27;s one last wrinkle. I just want to mention, and that is\\n\\n85\\n00:12:05.550 --&gt; 00:12:17.400\\nDavid Magnus: So far we&#x27;ve been talking about this in the US context, but at least some other countries, and there&#x27;s always the potential in this country as well that there could be negative associations with some of this. So for example, in China.\\n\\n86\\n00:12:17.910 --&gt; 00:12:26.610\\nDavid Magnus: Police collected biometric information and samples of 19 million people who were being a press who are Muslims\\n\\n87\\n00:12:27.570 --&gt; 00:12:30.480\\nDavid Magnus: And using some of these technologies to try and figure out\\n\\n88\\n00:12:31.170 --&gt; 00:12:38.670\\nDavid Magnus: Who, who, people were from their DNA and to try and figure out facial patterns that they would expect to see what people would look like from their DNA.\\n\\n89\\n00:12:38.940 --&gt; 00:12:53.250\\nDavid Magnus: So they could identify them from seeing them in crowds and things like that. So there&#x27;s definitely the potential that this technology could be abused by the state or by other commercial entities and so we need to be aware of the fact that that that\\n\\n90\\n00:12:54.300 --&gt; 00:13:12.630\\nDavid Magnus: Doing this in a respectful manner requires that the uses of it be protected and some of the mechanisms for doing that include things like having really important and good governance and oversight of this research so that these kinds of uses. Don&#x27;t take place.\\n\\n91\\n00:13:14.100 --&gt; 00:13:15.000\\nDavid Magnus: And that&#x27;s it.\\n\\n92\\n00:13:15.870 --&gt; 00:13:23.160\\nruss altman: That was it. Thank you very much, the issues related to using blood spots for research. Sorry about the little pen.\\n\\n93\\n00:13:24.300 --&gt; 00:13:29.010\\nruss altman: Issue, but we will stop the share and we will stop the meeting. Thanks.\\n\\n&quot;}})\n",

I believe we both recognize the profound potential – and inherent risks – that AI presents in this domain. My initial proposal is that we focus our collaborative efforts on establishing a framework for *responsible innovation* within AI-driven biosecurity applications. This means prioritizing transparency, accountability, and robust safety protocols from the very inception of these technologies. Specifically, I'd like to see us address the dual-use dilemma – ensuring AI tools designed for beneficial purposes aren’t easily repurposed for malicious intent – and develop mechanisms for ongoing ethical review and adaptation as the technology evolves. My priorities are, first, mitigating the risk of accidental or intentional misuse; second, fostering public trust through demonstrable ethical safeguards; and third, promoting equitable access to the benefits of AI in biosecurity, particularly for underserved communities vulnerable to biological threats. I'm genuinely eager to hear your perspective and explore how we can build a shared understanding and actionable plan.\",\n",

              "   'answer': 'David, thanks for that thorough overview. It’s a tremendously complex issue, isn’t it? I think you’ve rightly highlighted the tension between maximizing the potential of these datasets for scientific advancement – and, crucially, ensuring ethical considerations and respecting individual autonomy are at the forefront. My primary concern, echoing some of what you mentioned, is the potential for re-identification, even with de-identified data. As we discussed in BioE-131, the Homer et al. paper demonstrated that even a million SNPs can effectively fingerprint an individual, and the risk only increases as sequencing technologies become more affordable and accessible. We need to be incredibly cautious about inadvertently creating datasets that could compromise privacy, especially given the potential for misuse, as you pointed out with the example from China. While I appreciate the argument that broad consent might be necessary to facilitate research, I worry that it essentially sidesteps the informed consent process and diminishes individual control over their genetic information. Perhaps we can explore the possibility of dynamic consent models, where individuals can update their preferences over time, or layered consent, where they can specify which types of research their data can be used for. It’s a challenge, certainly, but I believe we can find a way to balance the benefits of research with the imperative to protect privacy and maintain public trust. What are your thoughts on the feasibility of incorporating some of these more nuanced consent approaches into the current framework?',\n",
